I am visiting for the first time and only for a week with my husband. We love to walk, eat good food, and explore.","role":"user"},{"content":"Sure! Here are five options for things to do in London on a rainy day:\n\n1. Visit The British Museum. Dedicated to human history, art and culture, The British Museum has over 8 million permanent objects in its collection and is spread over multiple floors and wings of its impressive Bloomsbury building. From its extensive collection of Egyptian mummies to the Rosetta Stone, there are numerous exhibitions to capture your imagination. The museum is free to enjoy, though runs separately ticketed exhibitions throughout the year, as well. \n\n2. Explore Spitalfields Market. Since the 17th century, traders have been operating out of this East London market selling food, art, antiques, jewellery, and so much more. Today, the covered market is a hot destination for fashion and food enthusiasts with numerous stalls and shops open every day of the week. On the weekends, the market hosts various community events including pop-up music festivals. \n\n3. Shop at Westfield London. Located in West London, Westfield London is an enormous shopping centre hosting roughly 320 stores and restaurants spread over 2.5 million square feet, including the high-end retail sector named The Village. In addition to a wide selection of food and shopping, there are multiple activity options including miniature golf, rock climbing, and a cinema. \n\n4. Visit the Barbican Centre. The Barbican Centre is a large performing arts centre in the City of London nestled in the impressive Barbican Estate, which is an impressive example of Brutalist architecture. The centre is home to both the London Symphony Orchestra and the BBC Symphony Orchestra, in addition to hosting multiple theatre performances, film screenings, and additional concerts. The public are also welcome to enjoy its library, dine in one of its three restaurants, or explore its vast indoor conservatory. \n\n5. Explore the Battersea Power Station. The Grade-II listed Battersea Power Station, which sits on the south bank of the Thames just west of Westminster, was recently refurbished and reopened as a shopping and leisure destination. Inside the building, there are various shops, eateries, and bard including Control Room B: a cocktail bar nestled within the original dials and controls of the power station. If there's a break in the rainy weather, the riverfront of the power station is lined with additional food stalls, and Battersea Park is a short five-minute walk away down the bank of the Thames. If the rain stays all day, though, there are plenty of activities sheltered by the power station including miniature gold, ping pong, and a cinema. \n\nWhether it's rain or shine, London has an endless supply of activities, sights, and eateries to ensure you have an unforgettable trip.

The music genre known as pirate metal is a unique blend of heavy metal and sea shanties, accompanied by folk instruments like the concertina. Despite the unusual mix, bands such as Alestorm have found success in this genre and have a dedicated following.\n2. Math rock is an indie rock style that utilizes complex time signatures and unusual meters. The genre emerged in the 1980s and peaked in the mid-1990s. Today, similar techniques have been adapted to pop music, resulting in the creation of the genre known as \"math pop.\"\n3. Steven Roden created the minimalist ambient music genre called \"lowercase\" in 2001 by manipulating and amplifying sounds made from handling paper. The genre is characterized by its quiet and unobtrusive nature and gained attention following the release of the compilation album \"Lowercase-Sound\" in 2002. Roden's track \"Bell Is The Truth (Berlin)\" exemplifies the beauty of the genre, created by tapping light bulbs in total darkness to produce bell-like sounds.\n4. Witch House is a genre that doesn't have any resemblance to house music, despite the name. It was coined by Travis Egedy (aka, Pictureplane) and features slow tempo, chopped and screwed songs with elements of goth, shoegaze, hip-hop, drone, noise, and industrial. Other artists, such as Clams Casino, Holy Other, and Zola Jesus, have also incorporated Witch House elements into their music. Though the genre burned out after a few years, it remains captivating.\n5. Skweee is a genre of mostly instrumental music that originated in Sweden and Finland, combining synth leads and basslines with funk and soul rhythms. Its name reflects the idea of squeezing out the grooviest sound possible. Skweee was also a major influence on dubstep during 2008-2009.","role":"assistant"}]}

Tlachihualtepetl, also called the Great Pyramid of Cholula, is 217 feet (66 meters) tall and its base is 1,476 by 1,1476 feet (450 by 450 meters). Its total volume is 157 million cubic feet. Due to its size, it took centuries to build. It was worked on several different times between 300 BC and 700 AD. There was a temple above it to worship Quetzalcoatl - the Aztec god of learning and books. However, the temple was abandoned around the 8th or 9th century AD. Over time, it became covered with vegetation. As a result, it blended in and Spaniards first mistook it for a hill when they conquered Mexico in 1521. They replaced the temple with a church and the pyramid stayed hidden until the 1930s when the earth started to erode. Archeologists have excavated and studied many parts of the pyramid since then, including the altars. It has also become a tourist attraction since then.

In 1976, my primary source of income came from TV appearances. You remember those, like The Hollywood Squares, Donny & Marie, The Sonny and Cher Show, and The Brady Bunch Hour? But after I left Ike, I started getting sued for all these gigs that we'd had to cancel. I had to resume touring with United Artists just to pay off my debts, but thanks to Bob Mackie I came back sexier than ever in 77! My career really took off, from cabaret shows in Vegas to tours across the US and Australia.  \n\nRough, my third solo album, came out in 1978 and was distributed across the U.S. and Europe! And then there was my next album, Love Explosion, which was my exploration into disco. Unfortunately, neither of these performed very well, so I ended up leaving United Artists. I still got to headline another tour, at least.\n\nin 1979, I ran into an Australian manager named Roger Davies. After he saw me perform in San Francisco at the Fairmont Hotel, he agreed to be my manager! I was back in the international spotlight, working in Italy on Luna Park and touring in South Africa. That move of mine got a lot of flack, and to tell you the truth, I regret my naivety about the apartheid. \n\nFlash forward to October 1981, when Rod Stewart saw me perform in New York City and invited me to perform on Saturday Night Live with him. The next month, I opened for the Rolling Stones on their American Tour. Early the next year, I got to perform on the Willem Ruis show in the Netherlands, and my song \"Shame, Shame, Shame,\" ended up being a hit. My cover of \"Ball of Confusion\" (that I recorded for B.E.F.) was really popular in European dance clubs. I even got to film an MTV music video for that song. I was one of the first black American artists on the channel. I also got to appear on Chuck Berry's television special that year. The rest, as they say, is history!\n\nSincerely, \nTina Turner","role":"assistant"}]}

Because this created many railroad scheduling and safety problems, however, Congress passed the Uniform Time Act in 1966. This law set the nationwide dates of daylight saving time from the last Sunday in April until the last Sunday in October. In 2007, Congress amended the act to expand the period in which daylight saving time is in effect from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November – dates that remain in effect today.\n\nThe Uniform Time Act allows states and territories to opt out of daylight saving time, however. Arizona and Hawaii are on permanent standard time, along with Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam and American Samoa.\n\nNow, many other states are considering whether to stop falling back and springing ahead. Several U.S. states have legislation and resolutions under consideration to support permanent standard time, while many others have been or are considering permanent daylight saving time. Legislation and resolutions for permanent standard time have increased from 15% in 2021 to 31% in 2023.\n\nIn March 2022, the U.S. Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act  in a bid to make daylight saving time permanent. But the House did not move forward with this legislation. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio reintroduced the bill on March 1, 2023.\n\nThe spike in activity among states seeking to break from these twice-yearly changes reflects how more people are recognizing the downsides of this practice. Now, it’s up to legislators to decide whether we end the time shift altogether, and to choose permanent standard or daylight saving time.","role":"user"},{"content":"After WWII, states were given the right to choose the start and end dates for daylight saving time, but this caused serious problems for rail schedules.

The statement is looking for numbers that get divided by 2 in the array and equal 0, which doesn't align with what you expect the function to do. \n\nInstead, you want to use the modulo operator to check for the remainder of a number that is being divided by 2. If a number is divided by 2 and returns a remainder of 0, then we can assume that it's an even number. So, the small change of 'if (nums[i] % 2 == 0)' should solve your issue. \n\nI've rewritten the function below with the correction.\n\npublic static List checkForEvens(int [] nums) {\n    ArrayList anwer = new ArrayList<Integer>();\n    for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\n    if(nums[i] % 2 == 0) {\n    answer.add(nums[i]\n     }  \n   }\n}","role":"assistant"}]}

His parents – Joseph Regan Leggett and Mary, née Martin – both teachers, took charge of the so-called Indian Academy there, later establishing a school at their home Lansdale Cottage.[3] Both had their verse published in provincial newspapers, and William's maternal aunt Rachel Martin was also a teacher and poet.\n\nWilliam was educated by his parents. His own verse began appearing as early as 1827 and when his anthology The Forest Wreath was published in 1833 he was hailed as a prodigy.[4] He followed his parents into teaching but in 1835 turned from his Anglican upbringing to become a missionary in the Wesleyan Church, serving at posts in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and the island of Montserrat, West Indies, where he witnessed the devastating earthquake of 8 February 1843.[5] In 1839 at Bathurst, New Brunswick, William married Mary Ann Stevens, the daughter of devout Wesleyans. She bore him three children, only one of whom survived infancy.[6] William's second volume of verse, Sacred Poetry By a Wesleyan Minister, appeared in 1840.[7] In 1845 he left for England to pursue a career in letters, at which point he disappears from Canadian records.

A few weeks ago, I finally succumbed to gravity in my precarious position atop a mountain of plushies and tumbled to the floor behind the dresser. I made no noise, for I am but a soft little teddy bear. Here I stay, alone and helpless. \n\nMy human came and went from her room, never once giving a thought to where I might be. I used to be her favorite, you know. Now, I'm a forgotten relic, wasting away as the dust slowly seeps into every crevice of my fur. I've long thought about what I would do if I could move. Would I just return to my position and await her celebration over my return? Maybe she had missed me, but in her grief-stricken state, hadn't said a word aloud in distress.\n\nNo, I decided. I would exact my revenge. If she would forget about the memories we shared, then I would sit on the edge of her consciousness, patiently waiting for her to recognize me. I had sat helplessly behind the dresser for months; I was willing to wait years for her to recognize the silent, oppressive force in her life—that mysterious cosmic pushback against every effort she made: me. \n\nI would hide her keys so that she was constantly late to work. I would dip her toothbrush in the toilet so that she would always feel mysteriously unclean, and I would open all of the windows while she was away and close them upon her return. She would enter, and the house would be humid and unforgiving, almost as if it didn't want her there. \n\nI would move items around until she became convinced that her mind was playing tricks on her, veering ever closer to the brink of insanity until finally, I would reveal myself to her. Then she would finally understand what it was like for me all those months forgotten. She would beg for me to return to the dresser, to be a normal part of her life, but I would refuse. I snapped back to the present, my eyes still hopelessly fixed on the corner of the room. If only I could move and escape this prison.","role":"assistant"}]}

I'm not sick, I just feel sort of blah. Make me a list of things of healthy habits I can do.","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a list of 12 healthy daily habits that you can start.\n\n1. Get up early. Getting up early is a great habit to have. People have a natural circadian rhythm that controls certain hormones. Waking up early will help you maintain your circadian rhythm.\n2. Drink water in the morning. Drinking water soon after you wake up will help keep you hydrated. Since low levels of dehydration are linked with fatigue and headaches, you should drink water when you first get up.\n3. Incorporate movement into your day. Human bodies were designed to move, yet many of your jobs are sedentary. You should incorporate movement into your day because exercise has tremendous health benefits.\n4. Go outside. Being outside will allow you to breathe some fresh air. The sunlight also provides vitamin D which your body needs. Deficiencies in vitamin D are linked to fatigue, low mood, and depression.\n5. Sit down to eat. Digestion occurs best when you are sitting down. \n6. Walking. Although walking is often overlooked as a healthy habit, it improves fitness, and heart health, and prevents gaining weight. Walking is also linked to improved posture and circulation.\n7. Cook for yourself. Cooking for yourself allows you to control what you are eating. Cooking is also a form of self-care that you can practice every day.\n8. Eat some vegetables. Eating vegetables is a healthy choice. By choosing to eat vegetables, you can reduce the number of unhealthy foods you eat.\n9. Limit your phone time. Studies have shown that the blue light emitted from phones leads to a reduction in melatonin which your body needs to regulate sleep. This can negatively affect your natural circadian rhythm.\n10. Do some cleaning. A messy physical space around you can affect your mood. Cleaning up can reduce frustration and make it easier to cook for yourself.\n11. Read something. Reading can stimulate growth, reduce stress, reduce age-related cognitive decline, and help you sleep at night.\n12. Get plenty of rest. It is recommended that you get at least 8 hours of sleep at night. Low-quality sleep and lack of sleep have been linked to several ailments. ","role":"assistant"}]}

In the blue corner, we have the reigning champion, Conor McGregor, who reminds me of a dear friend of mine from St. Olaf, Olaf Olafson. He was a gentle giant, but when he got riled up, let me tell you, he was a force to be reckoned with!\n\nNow, I remember my great-grandfather, Olaf, was a boxer. He had an incredible right hook and used to knock out his opponents in the first round. One time, he was up against a fighter who was twice his size, but Olaf had a secret weapon - his lucky rabbit's foot. He rubbed it before every fight for luck, and it never failed him. Sure enough, in the third round, he landed a lucky punch and knocked out the giant. It was a St. Olaf miracle!\n\nOh, the fight has started and they are really going at it. It's hard to tell who has the upper hand. Wait, Poirier is throwing some powerful punches, but Mcgregor is dodging them like a St. Olaf resident dodges questions about lutefisk. Oh my, Poirier took down McGregor with a move that I can only describe as a \"hootenanny flipper.\" I remember once in St. Olaf, we had a hootenanny, and one of the guests tried to do a flip, but he ended up landing on the buffet table and knocking over all the pickled herring. It was a real mess, but it looks like McGregor is going to be okay.\n\nThe fight is getting intense now, and the crowd is getting into it. They're cheering and shouting like they're at a St. Olaf snowman-building contest. McGregor is gaining the upper hand. He's landed a few good blows, and Poirier is looking rough.\n\nOh, and there it is! McGregor landed a knockout blow, and the crowd is going wild! It's sure has been an exciting night, and I'm sure my great-grandfather Olaf would be proud of these two fighters. \n\nReporting live from the octagon, I'm Rose Nylund, reminding you to always keep your lucky rabbit's foot close at hand.","role":"assistant"}]}

She made her debut on the London stage with the young up-and-coming Laurence Olivier in the play \"The Circle of Chalk.\" After receiving a drubbing for her voice and singing from the London critics, she paid a Cambridge University tutor to improve her speech, with the result that she acquired an upper-crust English accent. Later she appeared in Vienna, Austria, in the play \"Springtime.\"\n\nEuropean directors appreciated Wong's unique talents and beauty, and they used her in ways that stereotype-minded Hollywood, hemmed in by American prejudice, would not or could not. Moving to Germany to appear in German films, she became acquainted with German film personalities, including Marlene Dietrich and actress-filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl. She learned German and French and began to develop a continental European attitude and outlook. In Europe she was welcomed as a star. According to her biographer Graham Russell Gao Hodges, Wong hobnobbed with \"an intellectual elite that included princes, playwrights, artists and photographers who clamored to work with her.\" Anna May Wong was featured in magazines all over the world, far more than actresses of a similar level of accomplishment. She became a media superstar, and her coiffure and complexion were copied, while \"coolie coats\" became the rage. According to Hodges, \"[S]he was the one American star who spoke to the French people, more than Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford or Mary Pickford, the top American actresses of the time.\" But, ironically, \"[S]he's the one who's now forgotten.\" Wong was cast in Ewald André Dupont's silent film Piccadilly (1929) as a maid who is fired from her job at a London nightclub after dancing on top of a table, then rehired as a dancer to infuse the club with exotic glamour. Her first talkie was The Flame of Love (1930) (aka \"The Road to Dishonour\", although some sources claim it was \"Song\" aka \"Wasted Love\" in that same year), which was released by British International Pictures. In a time before dubbing, when different versions of a single film were filmed in different languages, Wong played in the English, French and German versions of the movie.\n\nParamount Pictures offered her a contract with the promise of lead roles in major productions. Returning to the US in 1930, Wong appeared on Broadway in the play \"On the Spot.\" It was a hit, running for 167 performances, and she moved on to Hollywood and Paramount, where she starred in an adaptation of Sax Rohmer's novel \"Daughter of Fu Manchu\" called Daughter of the Dragon (1931). She was back in stereotype-land, this time as the ultimate \"Dragon Lady,\" who with her father Fu Manchu (played by ethnic Swede Warner Oland, the future Charlie Chan) embodied the evil \"Yellow Peril.\" While \"Daughter of the Dragon\" may have been B-movie pulp, it enabled Wong to show off her talent by delivering a powerful performance.","role":"user"},{"content":"Anna Wong moved to Europe to escape stereotype casting, making her debut in London, and hired a tutor to help her improve her speech.

But the feeling can occur in almost every type of human relationship—from siblings competing for parental attention to coworkers trying to impress a respected boss.\n\nAlthough jealousy is a painful emotional experience, evolutionary psychologists regard it not as an emotion to be suppressed but as one to heed—as a signal or a wake-up call that a valued relationship is in danger and that steps need to be taken to regain the affection of a mate or friend. As a result, jealousy is seen as a necessary emotion, because it preserves social bonds and motivates people to engage in behaviors that maintain important relationships.","role":"user"},{"content":"I get jealous when I think about my partner talking to other women.

Mom said to never believe what you see on there,\" retorted Adelaide while attempting a pirouette that looked more like a failed attempt at scratching her back. \"Still,\" moaned Fred, \"you see the leopard siblings constantly dance in the savannah, and they make it look so easy.\" Fred's eyes slowly filled with tears of frustration as he stumbled over his chunky legs for the umpteenth time that morning. Adelaide giggled and claimed: \"That's obviously because they don't weigh as much as us! We are just not made for cool stuff like that.\" \n\n\"That's not a very nice thing to say,\" replied their mother, who had been observing their antics for a while without intervention. \"Just because our bodies are not as lithe as the leopards, does not mean that we are less worthy. We have many other talents that the leopards wished they had.\" Mother Elephant, slowly making her way to her teary-eyed son, offered her trunk to him to help him back onto his feet. \"We have extreme strength that is almost unparalleled in the animal world! And our trunks are amazing designs of nature that allow us to do so many different tasks that other animals could not even dream about achieving!\" This statement from Mother Elephant made Adelaide take a closer look at her trunk, observing its great strength and prehensility. Fred, too, analyzed the muscles on his body and admired the force that was hiding behind his hide; his tears now almost dried. \n\nMother Elephant smiled at her children, aware of the potency of her words. \"We all have different strengths and weaknesses, and it is important not to feel discouraged about the latter.

Physically, he seems no worse for the fall. He did a belly flop on the bricks, he says, and his nose took most of the impact. “He made a one-point landing,” as his father puts it. The cartilage was so badly smashed that an emergency-room surgeon had to remove it all, leaving Eagleman with a rubbery proboscis that he could bend in any direction. But it stiffened up eventually, and it’s hard to tell that it was ever injured. Eagleman has puckish, neatly carved features, with a lantern jaw and modish sideburns. In Baylor’s lab-coated corridors, he wears designer jeans and square-toed ankle boots, and walks with a bounce in his step that’s suspiciously close to a strut, like Pinocchio heading off to Pleasure Island.\n\nIf Eagleman’s body bears no marks of his childhood accident, his mind has been deeply imprinted by it. He is a man obsessed by time. As the head of a lab at Baylor, Eagleman has spent the past decade tracing the neural and psychological circuitry of the brain’s biological clocks. He has had the good fortune to arrive in his field at the same time as fMRI scanners, which allow neuroscientists to observe the brain at work, in the act of thinking. But his best results have often come through more inventive means: video games, optical illusions, physical challenges. Eagleman has a talent for testing the untestable, for taking seemingly sophomoric notions and using them to nail down the slippery stuff of consciousness. “There are an infinite number of boring things to do in science,” he told me. “But we live these short life spans.

People with schizophrenia are usually diagnosed between the ages of 16 and 30, after the first episode of psychosis. Starting treatment as soon as possible following the first episode of psychosis is an important step toward recovery. However, research shows that gradual changes in thinking, mood, and social functioning often appear before the first episode of psychosis. Schizophrenia is rare in younger children.\n\nSchizophrenia symptoms can differ from person to person, but they generally fall into three main categories: psychotic, negative, and cognitive.\n\nPsychotic symptoms include changes in the way a person thinks, acts, and experiences the world. People with psychotic symptoms may lose a shared sense of reality with others and experience the world in a distorted way. For some people, these symptoms come and go. For others, the symptoms become stable over time. Psychotic symptoms include:\n\nHallucinations: When a person sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels things that are not actually there. Hearing voices is common for people with schizophrenia. People who hear voices may hear them for a long time before family or friends notice a problem.\nDelusions: When a person has strong beliefs that are not true and may seem irrational to others. For example, individuals experiencing delusions may believe that people on the radio and television are sending special messages that require a certain response, or they may believe that they are in danger or that others are trying to hurt them.\nThought disorder: When a person has ways of thinking that are unusual or illogical. People with thought disorder may have trouble organizing their thoughts and speech. Sometimes a person will stop talking in the middle of a thought, jump from topic to topic, or make up words that have no meaning.\nMovement disorder: When a person exhibits abnormal body movements. People with movement disorder may repeat certain motions over and over.\nNegative symptoms include loss of motivation, loss of interest or enjoyment in daily activities, withdrawal from social life, difficulty showing emotions, and difficulty functioning normally.\n\nNegative symptoms include:\n\nHaving trouble planning and sticking with activities, such as grocery shopping\nHaving trouble anticipating and feeling pleasure in everyday life\nTalking in a dull voice and showing limited facial expression\nAvoiding social interaction or interacting in socially awkward ways\nHaving very low energy and spending a lot of time in passive activities. In extreme cases, a person might stop moving or talking for a while, which is a rare condition called catatonia.\nThese symptoms are sometimes mistaken for symptoms of depression or other mental illnesses.\n\nCognitive symptoms include problems in attention, concentration, and memory. These symptoms can make it hard to follow a conversation, learn new things, or remember appointments. A person’s level of cognitive functioning is one of the best predictors of their day-to-day functioning. Health care providers evaluate cognitive functioning using specific tests.\n\nCognitive symptoms include:\n\nHaving trouble processing information to make decisions\nHaving trouble using information immediately after learning it\nHaving trouble focusing or paying attention\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recognized that having certain mental disorders, including depression and schizophrenia, can make people more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19.

Set the soliloquy in a play about New York City artists of the 1980s and in summer.\n\nThe years 1981 to 1984 were a brief period of intense artistic output that cemented Jean-Michel Basquiat’s place within the canon of art history. Initially working under the moniker SAMO, Basquiat, a friend of artist Keith Haring and actress Patti Astor, became an integral member of the social circle around the Mudd Club, the night club–gallery hybrid that defined downtown that decade. In 1981, Mudd Club cofounder Diego Cortez put the 21-year-old Basquiat—then known mainly as a street artist—in a group show called “New York\/New Wave,” and he was well on his way to fame from there.\n\nBy 1983, Basquiat had found his way into the posse of the former Met curator Henry Geldzahler. That year, a discussion between Geldzahler and the artist published in Interview magazine limned the now-famous key elements of Basquiat’s work: royalty, heroism, and the streets. Despite his youth, the artist’s creative agility and his political acumen allowed him to emerge as major force unifying street art with painting, in effect bridging the gap between modes that have historically been considered high and low art. By the time Basquiat died at age 27 in 1988, he had become one of the top artists working in New York.\n\nOver the subsequent decades, Basquiat’s stature as an artist would be reevaluated by the very institutions in which he remains under-represented. Basquiat is among the most highly valued artists in the art market, and his work, all completed in the brief period between 1981 and 1984, regularly sells at auction for tens of millions of dollars. ","role":"user"},{"content":"I am Jean-Michel Basquiat. That's what my mom and pops called me. Here I stand, among the daisies in Central Park, green grass at my feet. You wanna talk names? When I first started as a street artist, I used the name SAMO. Diego found me; he had this club in '81 called the Mudd Club. My buddies Keith Haring and Patti Astor, we all ran together in the Mudd Club. \n\nTwo years later, around 1983, I found my way to Henry. Henry was a curator at the Met. That magazine, Interview, published one of our conversations where I talked about themes I was exploring in my work: royalty, heroism and the streets. I was young. So young. They liked the way I moved though, between the streets and those fancy high-art galleries. I was doing some of my best work and I was just this kid in my 20s. By the time I was 27, I was one of the top artists in the Big Apple. \n\nI wonder what they'll think of me decades from this Spring day. In the future, will they include me in their high-art institutions? Will my work sell for millions of dollars in the future? I can't think about that now. I just want to paint and create and push my ideas into the world. We'll see where I end up after all. ","role":"assistant"}]}

Let's start by finding a comfortable position—perhaps seated with crossed legs, reclined, or maybe sprawled on your couch in front of the television with a bowl of popcorn on your lap—whatever stance will best support you in emptying your mind.\n\nNow let’s close our eyes and start to turn inward. If you feel immediately overwhelmed by feelings of guilt and self-loathing, that’s a sign you’re a mediocre or possibly bad person and you’ve turned too far inward, so dial it back a little. Focus on the sensation of breathing. How does it feel to fill the lungs with air and then release it all? If this sensation is uncomfortable, it’s possible you're actually a vampire or supernatural being that doesn't thrive on oxygen; if so, don’t panic. Close this video and search our home page for a video titled \"Guided meditation for sentient beings who do not breathe.\"\n\nIf you’re still with me, let’s begin a practice of progressive relaxation. Starting with the toes, we’ll scan the body for areas that are holding tension and manually relax them. How? I’m afraid there's no simple answer—just try to relax these muscles, and if they resist, impose your will by force. You might ask your doctor about a prescription for muscle relaxers.\n\nLet's bring attention to areas of the body that tend to be ignored. What does it feel like to release tension from your belly button? How does it feel to have relaxed fingernails? I’m seriously asking—this is not a rhetorical question. My manicurist says my fingernails exhibit symptoms of PTSD. Drop a comment below to reply. Please. I’m desperate.\n\nNow we'll draw our meditation to a close. Open your eyes slowly.\n\nAs you may be aware, this meditation hasn’t done anything to solve the world’s problems, improve your lot in life, or remedy the hurt you've caused others, but it should have at least helped you feel better about these problems without actually lifting a finger to change anything. So I hope you’ll like this video, subscribe, and join us for another guided meditation tomorrow so you can continue to feel superficially at peace about the impending apocalypse and evil impulses simmering quietly inside your soul.

Create an Outline: Writing an outline fleshes out the core ideas in your essay, helping you to focus on each section and the relevant data\/quotes when you write your rough draft. \n3. Use and Cite Outside Sources: Most college essays necessitate some level of research, and in order for your paper to be compelling, you will need to support your claims using quotes and, in some cases, statistics and data. Find a reputable source that provides helpful, relevant information that you can quote or incorporate to develop your writing. Just be certain to cite any sources you include, whether those sources are direct or indirect.\n4. Create a Rough Draft: A rough draft translates your outline into a structured essay with an introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.\n5.

Each section should include bullet points\n\nGlorious humanoids with gilded armors, beautiful wings, perfect faces, and an all-righteous nature that brings warmth, comfort, and solace — that’s how we picture angels. After all, that’s how we’ve depicted the majestic creatures throughout history in every piece of art and literature.\n\nIs this common description a portrayal of our reimagination, or does it have a striking resemblance to angels who rule heaven?\n\nAccording to the Bible, it would appear that we’re in the wrong. Unlike the gentle, human-like apparitions we’re familiar with, angels look strange, terrifying even. And it would appear that there’s a good reason behind it.\n\n\nBiblical Depiction of an Angel via reddit.com\nConceptualizing Angels: A Brief History\nThe word “angel” has a couple of origins. It is derived from the Greek word “angelos,” and the Greek word, in turn, comes from the Hebrew word “Mal’ akh,” which stands for messenger.\n\n\nWhen we’re visualizing an angel, we’re often thinking of Malakim, who acted on God’s behalf in the Old Testament to carry out his judgment and took on the role of messengers in the New Testament.\n\nMalakim are said to be the closest depiction of human beings. However, they are not mentioned in the Bible as beings with wings.\n\nIndeed, the earliest known Christian image of an angel, from the mid-third century, depicted them as human-like beings without wings.\n\nThis image, however, changed in the late fourth century as artists reimagined angels with wings to represent their sublime nature, even though the scripture makes no mention of wings.\n\n\nPopular Angels and Their Biblical Forms\nLet’s take a look at some of the most well-known depictions of the angels we’re familiar with and how much they differ from their Biblical descriptions.\n\nCherubim\nAccording to the Bible, cherubim are responsible for guarding the Garden of Eden — the Biblical terrestrial paradise — against humankind when Adam and Eve, the first humans, were driven out of the heavenly garden.\n\nThe prophet Ezekiel’s vision of cherubim is depicted in the Book of Ezekiel in which they are portrayed as having four faces — one of an eagle, one a human, one an ox, and finally a lion.\n\nCherubim have straight legs, four wings (one set covers their body while the other is used for flying), and bull hooves for feet.\n\n\nCherubim – Art by Art by KelbremDusk\nSubscribe to the History Defined newsletter!\nGet updates on the latest posts and more from History Defined straight to your inbox.\n\nYour Email...\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nI consent to receiving emails and personalized ads.\nThis portrayal is nothing like what we imagine them to be. Cherubim, commonly known as cherubs, are depicted as chubby, beautiful, naked children with wings in art, as represented by Renaissance sculptors who revived the ancient practice of putti.\n\n\nThese depictions of Cherubim are often connected with divinity. These animal-human hybrids have also been associated with cupids, the diaper-clad chubby babies who are sometimes shown with a trumpet and arrow to symbolize romantic love.\n\nSome attribute this modern-day image to cupid-like Greek and Roman deities. On the other hand, the Biblical image is frequently attributed to cultural exchanges with ancient Babylonia, Egypt, and Syria, which explains their mixed appearance. \n\n\nSeraphim\nAccording to the Christian angel hierarchy, seraphim hold the highest rank. In art, the four-winged cherubim are painted in blue to symbolize the sky, while the six-winged seraphim are painted in red to symbolize fire.\n\nThe Hebrew term “Saraph” means “venomous desert snake” and “Seraph” means “to burn.” These terms are the two main historical influences on Seraphim’s name.\n\nThe Bible describes seraphim as having six wings, four of which are used to cover their heads and feet in front of God as a symbol of humility, and the remaining two are used to fly.\n\nThey are second in ranking in the angel hierarchy, with their sheer presence emitting holiness. And unlike the ophanim and cherubim, seraphim are not guard-angels. \n\n\nSeraphim\nSeraphim are described by prophet Isaiah as angelic beings that continually worship God by surrounding God’s throne and singing “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory” in unison when God approaches.\n\n\n\nWhile they’re the epitome of helpfulness and forgiveness, their appearance instills fear in the prophet.\n\nSeveral historians suggest that the description of the Seraphim’s wings and flames may have been based on the connection with Egyptian imagery and description of the cobra.\n\nOphanim\n“Their entire bodies, including their backs, hands, and wings, were full of eyes all around, as were their four wheels.” (Ezekiel 10:12)\n\n\n\nOphanim, or “the wheels,” are one of the strangest, most bizarre beings referenced in Ezekiel’s vision. They’re portrayed as beings made of interlocking gold wheels, with every wheel adorned with numerous sets of eyes on the exterior.\n\nThese wheels, however, do not change directions as the creatures move by floating in the skies. \n\n\nOphanim\nThe second book of Enoch refers to ophanim as “many-eyed ones.” They are sometimes also described as spheres or whirlwinds. They’re also classified as “thrones.”\n\n\n\nThere’s an interesting theory that the ophanim are the wheels attached to God’s chariot. Others, like former NASA scientist Jose F. Blumrich, believe ophanim might have been what we would consider a UFO sighting today.\n\nWhile they’re not considered angels in the Bible, the Jewish angelic hierarchy considers them responsible for guarding God’s throne and being the angels closest to God. This notion also coincides with beliefs held in different traditions.\n","role":"user"},{"content":" Introduction\n\nHow we picture angels:\n\n•Gilded armor\n•Beautiful wings\n•Glorious humanoids\n•All-righteous nature\n•Comfort, warmth, and solace\n\nWhere majestic angels appear:\n\n•Every piece of art\n•Every piece of literature\n\nBiblical angels are:\n•Strange\n•Terrifying\n•Inhuman\n\nOrigins of the word “angel”:\n•Derived from the Greek “Angelos”\n•Greek word is derived from the Hebrew “Mal’ akh”\n•“Mal’ akh” means “messenger”\n\nTypes of Angels\n\nMalakim\n•Appeared in Old Testament to carry out God’s judgment\n•Appeared as messengers in the New Testament\n•Closest to human beings\n•Are never mentioned as having wings in the Bible\n•Third-century Christian image of an angel is the earliest known image\n•This image depicts angels as wingless humans\n•Images of wings were imagined by artists during the late 4th century\n\nCherubim \n•Guarded the Garden of Eden against humans after Adam and Eve were removed\n•Depicted in Ezekiel\n•Have four faces\n•Faces are an ox, a lion, a human, and an eagle\n•Have straight legs\n•Have four wings\n•One set of wings covers the body\n•One is for flying\n•Have bull hooves instead of feet\n•Depictions in art as naked, chubby, beautiful winged children\n•This comes from Renaissance sculptors practicing putti\n•Cherubs in the art are associated with cupids\n•Modern image is similar to Greco-Roman deities\n•Biblical image attributed to ancient Egypt, Syria, and Babylon\n•Painted blue to symbolize the sky in art\n\nSeraphim\n•Highest-ranking angel in the Christian hierarchy\n•In art, painted red to symbolize fire\n•Six wings\n•Four wings cover feet and heads in humility when appearing before God\n•Two wings are used for flight\n•Influenced by the Hebrew “Saraph” meaning “venomous desert snake”\n•Influenced by the Hebrew “Seraph” meaning “to burn”\n•Their presence emits holiness\n•They are not guard angels\n•Described by Isaiah as continually worshiping God\n•They surround God’s throne and sing his glory in unison when God is near\n•Helpful\n•Forgiving\n•Instilled fear in the Prophet Isaiah\n•Some historians suggest a connection to Egyptian cobra imagery in the Seraphim’s flames and wings\n\nOphanim\n•Described as four wheels made of eyes all around in Ezekiel\n•Described as “many-eyed ones” in Enoch\n•Made of interlocking gold wheels\n•Each wheel has many sets of eyes on its exterior\n•Float in the sky\n•Wheels do not change direction as they move\n•Sometimes described as whirlwinds\n•Sometimes described as spheres\n•Classified as Thrones\n•Some theorize they are the wheels of God’s chariot\n•NASA scientist Jose F.

Not having ever heard of a restaurant like this, I decided to check it out. \n\nThe place was well-lit when I entered, though the decor was far too eccentric for my liking. The idea for a shoe-themed restaurant with shoes on the wall is a decent idea if used in moderation. I feel like Laces took it a bit too far. My disappointment did not end there. With no host or hostess, I needed to find my own seating. This can be fine in certain establishments, but here the options were extremely limited given the size of the dining room. \n\nOnce seated, I spent upwards of thirty minutes waiting for service. I did think, at one point, that it was a buffet. I grabbed something off of a table and brought it back to my seat, but it was impossible to cut through, and something stringy kept getting stuck in my teeth. Without any staff presenting themselves to me, I asked to speak with the manager. The manager tried to tell me that they don't have any food at Laces, which is of course ridiculous since I found it online and the internet never tells lies. I left hungry and angry. Heed my warning. Do not eat at Laces. Anyone going there for a romantic night out or a relaxing bite after work will be sorely disappointed. ","role":"assistant"}]}

New York City Marathon\nNew York is a major city in the United States as well as the world. Its marathon is no different. Each year, the New York Marathon brings in up to 50,000 runners. The starting places are strictly regulated, however, and there is a split quota between New York residents, Americans, and anyone else. This means your chances are slim if you are not from New York or America, but you can purchase tickets with a tour company, which may be the best way for non-USA citizens to attend. The marathon is run around early November, and anyone over 18 is welcome to apply.\n\n2. Chicago\nStaying in America, the next marathon on the list is Chicago, which is in the state of Illinois. Regularly drawing 40,000 participants, the Chicago marathon is a great way to push yourself to the limit and see one of the United States' most populous cities. It is a bit easier to get a ticket for the Chicago marathon with no qualifying times and an entry age of just 16. The registration closes at a max of 45,000. The Chicago marathon takes place in mid-October.\n\n3. Paris\nThe city of love, Paris, is an incredible place full of sights, smells, and sounds. In early April, it is also the host of the third-largest marathon in the world. About 40,000 descend on France's capital to test themselves in the streets where Napoleon used to walk. Entry differs from the USA marathons, with participants needing a sports health certificate signed by a doctor. You can apply online or in writing; the minimum age is 18.\n\n4. London\nA historical city like no other, London hosts one of the most sought-after marathons in mid-April each year and boasts around 35,000 crossing the finish line each year. Any foreigners will struggle to get a starting place for this famous race, with 7% as the reported number for how many foreigners finish each year. The best and easiest way to get a ticket for the London marathon is to purchase one through a travel agent.\n\n5. Berlin\nWhere better to run 26.2 miles than the German capital of Berlin? Take in the war monuments seemingly on every corner while you compete with a limited 40,000 people to get around Berlin the most quickly. As with the London marathon, the best way to get a ticket for the Berlin marathon is through a travel agent or charity provider.","role":"assistant"}]}

Its construction was a result of efforts to control floods and provide water for irrigation to transform the American Southwest from an arid region into fertile cropland. Also, it was seen as a suitable solution for the water needs of the Los Angeles region and Southern California. Construction began in 1930, it was dedicated in 1935, and hydroelectric generators went online in 1937. The dam was built for $49 million then, and the power plant and generators cost an additional $71 million.

Well, no that isn't quite right, I'm a cucumber right now but soon I will be a pickle.\n\nDays ago some friendly hands picked me up from my nice sunny patch in the field. I was about ready to come in, to be honest, the heat was getting to me and there were far too many rabbits lurking around. It was very nice to be carried inside, given a nice cool bath, and set aside for the night to sleep and relax.\n\nI woke up a bit later than usual still surrounded in the colander by my other cucumber friends. They were still sleeping so I did my best not to disturb them. They weren't a talkative bunch normally anyway. The sun was just starting to peak in through the curtains above the sink when a lady entered the room. The same lady who grabbed me from the patch yesterday. She seemed very friendly and nice.\n\nAt least I thought so until she picked me up, bowl and all, and gave me a big shake. What a way to rise and shine. I could hear the other cucumbers grumbling too. She transported us a few feet away to another part of the countertop. Then, the lady mixed a bunch of ingredients in a big pot on the stove and it started to smell good but it also tickled my nose a bit. Perhaps a bit too garlicky for my tastes. \n\nNext thing I knew she was picking me up again but this time she stuck me in a jar! I couldn't believe it, it was finally happening! It's the most exciting day in any gherkins life. A few of my other cucumber friends joined me and we all nestled up close to each other. It was very cozy and everyone had a nice view through the glass too.\n\nThen, the nice lady gave us a warm bath. It felt even nicer than the cool bath I had before. It had hints of dill and pepper and it covered me from my tippy toes all the way to the top of my head. She put a nice little roof over top sealing me in. And I knew that from this day forward I was a cucumber no more, now I was one proud pickle.","role":"assistant"}]}

Chronic lack of rest is linked to a host of health issues, so “it’s important to protect and prioritize sleep the following night, maybe even by going to bed a bit earlier than usual to catch up on some of the sleep you lost the night before,” Dr. Barwick says. “We can’t make up all of the sleep loss from a restless night, but research shows that sleeping a little longer the following one to two nights can help us recover faster.” In other words, one night of bad sleep—while not ideal—isn’t the end of the world, despite the zombie vibes.","role":"user"},{"content":"Sleep deprivation can make you feel like a zombie.

At first actors toured in companies, travelling the country to perform in towns and cities and in private homes. By the time Shakespeare died, London had several permanent theatres where the actors performed, drawing in huge audiences. Yet, despite the popularity of play-going, the acting profession had a bad reputation. Actors were seen as unruly and a threat to a peaceful society.\n\nWho became an actor?\n\nIn Shakespeare’s time acting was a profession only open to boys and men. Women were acting elsewhere in Europe but they were not allowed to perform in public theatres in England until 1660. In an Elizabethan production boys would play the female parts, like Ophelia in Hamlet or Desdemona in Othello, whilst occasionally men would play the older women. There were many more actors working across the country at the time, but these are some of the best known Elizabethan actors: Richard Burbage, Edward Alleyn, Robert Armin, William Kemp and Nathan Field.\n\nWhat was an actor’s training?\n\nMany actors began their careers as young boys. They could join a company as an apprentice and be taught by one of the more senior actors within the company. Actors were expected to be able to sword fight, sing and dance, as well as having a good memory for learning lines.\n\nHow big was a company?\n\nCompany sizes varied, depending on where the company was working and how wealthy the company was. A wealthy company, when working in a theatre, might have 8– 12 senior members called sharers, 3–4 boys, a number of hired players (hired men) and then stage hands, tiremen (who would help the actors dress back stage) and some musicians. Actors would join a company under the patronage of a monarch (like the Queen’s Men) or a nobleman, such as the Lord Admiral’s Men or the Lord Chamberlain’s Men. \n\nWhere did a company work?\n\nMost companies were based in London, using one of the permanent theatres. Sometimes the theatres were closed, for example when there was a plague in the city, and so companies would then go on tour. Mostly they toured England, but companies did also go abroad, particularly to the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nWhat did an actor earn?\n\nMany theatre companies operated a shareholder system. Sharers in a company earned more than the hired men. Shakespeare was a sharer of the Chamberlain’s Men, later the King’s Men, and so shared the costs and also the profits the company made. Actors’ earnings also depended on where the company was playing. The company made more money in London than in the country, so could pay actors higher wages. In 1597 the actor William Kendall was paid 10 shillings a week in London but only 5 shillings in the country.\n\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Before Shakespeare’s lifetime, actors, who were only men or boys, toured in companies.

In Elizabethan productions, the roles of females were played by boys and occasionally, when an older female was required, by men. Boys often started their careers in their youth by becoming an apprentice. Older actors would teach them sword fighting, singing, and dancing. Among the most famous Elizabethan actors were Richard Burbage, Edward Alleyn, Robert Armin, William Kemp, and Nathan Field. In a wealthy company under the patronage of a monarch or nobleman, a senior actor - of which there were 8-12 - could earn as much as 10 shillings a week for performances in London.","role":"assistant"}]}

Keeping a plant healthy reduces the risk of pest infestations. \n\nUse the following passage to answer the question.\n\nHow to Treat Yellowing Leaves on Snake Plant\nOnce you narrow down the reason your snake plant has yellow leaves, you'll want to address the issue quickly to keep your plant healthy. However, yellow leaves won't turn green again even if the issue is remedied, so it's best to cut them off with sharp, sanitized pruners or scissors at the base of the plant.\n\nCheck your plant's soil moisture. If the soil feels soggy and you've been watering frequently, overwatering could be to blame. Let the soil dry out completely before watering again. In extreme cases, you may need to repot the plant in fresh soil and inspect the roots for signs of rot.\n\nIf your snake plant's leaves look sunburned and the plant is getting direct sunlight, move it further away from the light source or use a sheer curtain to filter the light and make it less intense. Address inconsistent temperature by keeping the plant away from drafty areas and putting it in a space with a more consistent temperature.\n\nInspect your snake plant regularly for signs of pests. Remove insects with blasts of water or a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol, then use neem oil or horticultural soap to prevent them from coming back. Keep your plant healthy going forward to lessen the likelihood that pests will attack.\n\nIf you haven't fertilized or refreshed your snake plant's soil in a few years and other causes don't apply, repot it with fresh soil. If the plant seems potbound, use a pot one size larger or divide the plant and repot it in its original container. If you suspect overfertilizing is the issue, flush your plant's soil several times with water to remove excess nutrients. Going forward, only fertilize your snake plant twice per year in spring and summer.","role":"user"},{"content":"The statement is true.","role":"assistant"}]}

I remember when they came into the league. They were originally called the Devil Rays. They were absolutely awful back then. They were the laughingstock of baseball. Their roster was full of has-beens and never will be's, and occasionally a future Hall of Famer looking for a final paycheck. They were notably bad, even for a young franchise.\n\nEventually, even our mascot became reviled, with some folks saying that the Devil himself was cursing our franchise. As a result, they rebranded to simply be the Tampa Bay Rays, trying to invoke the image of a sunbeam. They improved, against all odds. They never made the playoffs from 1998-2007 and then made the playoffs seven times from 2008-2021. They even made the World Series twice. But of course, they lost. Because that's what the Rays do. They give you just enough hope, only to break your heart again. Some folks will say that's just baseball. But it doesn't make it any less unfair for the rest of us. ","role":"assistant"}]}

With one leap, she jumped into it and slid down into the hamper in the basement. A big black box with an open door stood in the middle of the basement, equipped with flashing lights and a lit-up floor with a series of numbers. She knew that the box had been created by the scientist husband of the family, so she confidently jumped from the hamper and landed on the box's floor.

She figured that it was from her master, so it should be okay to use it. Putting it between her teeth, she jokingly said, \"Fangs a lot, master!\" She then sprinted forward and yelled, \"Charge!\" Here are five stores she visited, along with an item she \"purchased\" at each store:\n\n( ● ) Filene's - A bottle of \"Cat Got Your Tongue\" perfume\n( ● ) Camelot Music - a copy of Al Stewart's \"Year Of The Cat\" LP\n( ● ) B.

Woolworth - a large plate of tuna casserole from the lunch counter\n( ● ) Sear's - a family cat condo with a separate bathroom for Tabitha\n\nIt quickly got \"discovered\" that the card account was fake. Before the local pound could snag her up in their net, another flash of light suddenly occurred. Tabitha found herself back at her house, standing in front of her master, who said \"Chute! I left the laundry access open!\" Unfortunately, Tabitha's purchases were not \"past\" over to the present, but at least she didn't have a boring day!","role":"assistant"}]}

Superman, noticing Batman's flummoxed expression, gave him a nod and then they both ran down the corridor to the security room.\n\nReaching the bank of computers and monitors, they could see a new report of an explosion in Mumbai of a potentially alien origin.\n\nSuperman looked at Batman and said, \"Well, there's no pizza in Mumbai but you better believe we're getting a slice when we're done.\"\n\n\"You got it,\" Batman replied, \"Let's suit up and save the day.\"\n","role":"assistant"}]}

They should have met at dawn because Hannah said that was the correct time for duels, but Bella refused to get up so early. The duel was, therefore, set for nine o'clock. Neither Hannah nor Lizzie slept that night, but each was quietly sure she would win. Hannah had been practicing calling Vanilla to her for weeks, and Vanilla was pretty good at it now. She knew that when Lizzie had had the puppy, it was too young to train - Vanilla couldn't possibly go to Lizzie. But Vanilla could sometimes be naughty. Could she be sure? \n\nAt the corner shop, Hannah bought a pouch of aniseed balls and put them in her pocket where the smell would surely be carried on her hands: dogs were supposed to find aniseed irresistible. 'I did want some anyway,' Hannah told herself. But it wasn't true - she would never have bought aniseed balls for herself. Hannah was really cheating. \n\nLizzie wished she hadn't agreed to a duel, but she couldn't get out of it now. She let Hannah take Fudge - her name for the puppy - home that night because she reckoned that Fudge would rush to greet her and not go to Hannah. But she had no qualms about putting a piece of raw steak in her pocket. It felt horrible, and she knew she would get into trouble with Bella over it. Well, too bad; this was an emergency. \n\nHannah had written out the rules carefully on a bit of paper. She read them out in her thin, clear voice. One or two people stopped to watch, but when some children ran into the dueling area, Bella shoed them away. The two girls would stand forty paces apart, with Bella in the middle holding the puppy. Then, when they were ready, Bella would give the signal and let go. Neither Lizzie nor Hannah was allowed to move, but they would each call the puppy's name. Whichever of them she ran to would be the winner and the puppy's owner. Bella was the judge, and her decision was final. \n\n'Twenty paces, then,' said Hannah. They counted out the steps and turned to face each other. Bella looked at both the girls to check they were ready. First one, and then the other nodded. 'Now!' Bella said and let go.","role":"assistant"}]}

Soon he felt his knees and skin prickle with the lapping water. Then his cardigan got wet. Then his grizzled chin and his lank hair became the playthings of the sea. \n\nNigel kept walking.

This may be useful if you do not wish to incur a \"game over\" screen for this rash decision by the player.\n3. Lay a log across the chasm: The player could command the character to look for a suitably long log to balance across the chasm. Alternatively, they could attempt to chop down a tree over the chasm. This would not work if the tree was of insignificant length to cover the gap or if the character was not strong enough to lift up and drop a sufficiently long log. \n4.

This could fail if there is no way across, or if the path across is visible but not accessible. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a rapidly moving river or a significant elevation difference. \n5. Acquire a vehicle: The player could command the character to look for a vehicle.

Eve, fresh out of Harvard Business School, has fired “the gray hairs,” put the managing editor in a supply closet, stopped using the landlines, and hired a bevy of manicured and questionably attired underlings who text and tweet their way through meetings. Imogen, darling of the fashion world, may have Alexander Wang and Diane von Furstenberg on speed dial, but she can’t tell Facebook from Foursquare and once got her iPhone stuck in Japanese for two days. Under Eve’s reign, Glossy is rapidly becoming a digital sweatshop—hackathons rage all night, girls who sleep get fired, and “fun” means mandatory, company-wide coordinated dances to Beyoncé. Wildly out of her depth, Imogen faces a choice—pack up her Smythson notebooks and quit, or channel her inner geek and take on Eve to save both the magazine and her career. A glittering, uproarious, sharply drawn story filled with thinly veiled fashion personalities, The Knockoff is an insider’s look at the ever-changing world of fashion and a fabulous romp for our Internet-addicted age.”\n\nTo say that the two clash is an understatement. Imogen struggles to learn the new rules of doing business to capitalize on the available technology, while Eve just wants Imogen out of the way. The dynamic between the two is fraught with tension and frustration and achingly realistic. Talk to anyone in management above a certain age, and they will all have stories similar to Imogen’s. Then again, talk to anyone Eve’s age and her frustrations are their frustrations. The Knockoff captures the individual sides perfectly.\n\nThere is a lot to love in The Knockoff. Think of it as The Devil Wears Prada for the next generation. However, to expect the same story as Prada would be to seriously underestimate the twists and turns The Knockoff has in store for readers. Anyone who has ever been frustrated at work due to a genuine clash in personality and expectations should read The Knockoff. In fact, it would make a fantastic book club option, as it is quick, light, and humorous, and yet presents multiple situations and characters that are open to interpretation.","role":"user"},{"content":"No worries, dear!\n  The Knockoff made me laugh, and I think you'll get a kick out of it for very different reasons.  Authors Lucy Sykes and Jo Piazza describe the clash between a Gen X fashion magazine executive back from a six-month leave who discovers that her publication, Glossy, has been turned into an app.  The main character, Imogen Tate, is cool and friends with everybody in the fashion world; whereas the 20-something leading the app project - Harvard MB Eve, Imogen's former assistant!- makes her young team of employees works all night and participate in stupid dances, before viciously firing them for trivial reasons.  Imogen doesn't have the slightest clue about tech or apps (she's more of a Smythson notebook kind of person) but realizes that she has to learn a few things quickly before Eve destroys everything she has worked to build.  No spoilers, but think of it as a sort of updated The Devil Wears Prada.  It will make you laugh and might remind you of a few people you know.","role":"assistant"}]}

One day, Gertie, as her friends called her, ventured out farther than she had ever been before, far past the old cabin where the old woman lived, far past the berry bushes where the squirrels liked to eat, and past the babbling brook where the bears liked to catch fish. She went out far past the pines toward the edge of the forest where it met the neighboring town. It was late at night and cars were buzzing about the highway. Lights were flickering, but they were very much unlike the lightning bugs and stars Gertie was used to seeing. \n\nShe wasn't used to all the noise and commotion going on around her. Unsure of where she was, she decided to turn back and head home. So she had to fly past the pines again, stopping to pick up a few pine cones to collect for home. She stopped to listen to the sound of the babbling brook and munched on a few ripe raspberries at the berry bushes. She stayed a while to talk to her squirrel friends before heading off to fly past the old cabin and finally make her way back home, where she told her friends about all the new wonders she experienced outside the forest.

These atomic clocks use the vibrations of atoms to keep time with extreme accuracy, thereby providing a much more consistent measure of time than methods based on the rotation of our planet or its revolution around the sun.\n\nCoordinated Universal Time is the time standard used in aviation, computing, navigation, weather forecasting, and many other fields. Unlike TAI, which is purely atomic in nature, UTC is closely aligned with mean solar time (a modern replacement for Greenwich Mean Time) and accounts for variations in Earth's rotational speed by occasionally introducing \"leap seconds\". While TAI ticks away uniformly, the Earth's rotation gradually slows down over time. This means that UTC, which is pegged to the Earth's rotation, occasionally falls out of sync with TAI. To correct this, a \"leap second\" is added to UTC approximately every 18 months, although the exact timing is determined by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS).

Jewelry: Gold's exceptional lustre and resistance to tarnish due to its inert nature have rendered it a preferred choice for crafting jewelry for millennia. Over half of the gold consumed today is converted into jewelry. Gold is both ductile and malleable, which enables it to be shaped into intricate designs that retain their form and beauty over substantial periods. Its chemical inertness ensures it remains unaffected by most chemicals, thereby preserving its aesthetic appeal even after prolonged use.\n2. Investment: Gold serves as a tangible asset that conserves its value over time, making it a popular choice as a financial hedge against inflation and currency instability. This is in part due to its limited availability – the cumulative quantity of gold mined throughout human history would fill merely about three Olympic-sized swimming pools. Gold's easy storability and globally recognized value also make it a sought-after asset during times of economic instability.\n3. Electronics: With its superior electrical conductivity and high resistance to corrosion and tarnish, gold plays an invaluable role in electronics, accounting for approximately 10% of global gold use. Gold is integral to a variety of electronic devices, encompassing smartphones, GPS units, televisions, and computers. In these applications, gold is typically employed in connectors, switch and relay contacts, soldered joints, and bonding wires.","role":"assistant"}]}

These ideas take into account your openness to most things, your love of outdoor activities, and the fact that you aren't religious. Each idea includes a description so that you can better understand whether or not you'd be open to it: \n\n1. Sports Leagues. Given your interest in being active outdoors, consider joining a recreational sports league. Search online or ask around at your workplace or gym to see what leagues are available to join. Pick a sport you think you might enjoy and choose a league that is appropriate for your anticipated skill level. Joining a sports league is a great way to get outside, engage in friendly competition, and most importantly, meet new people. \n2. Volunteering. Pretty much every city should have volunteer organizations where you can donate your time. Volunteering is not only a great way to give back and help those in need, but it's also a perfect way to connect with other volunteers and bond over your shared commitment to helping others. Make sure to look for a volunteer opportunity that suits your schedule, isn't too far from where you live, and is something that you will ultimately find fulfilling. Also, consider an opportunity that allows you to spend the majority of your time outside given your love of outdoor activities. \n3. Book Club. If you are someone who enjoys reading and discussing what you're reading with others, consider joining a book club. Book clubs are often organized monthly and involve meeting as a group to discuss a particular book that's been designated for that month. Not only will you get to read and talk about an interesting selection of new books, but joining a book club is a perfect way to expand your social circle and get to know a large group of people who share your interest. \n4. Running Groups. As someone who enjoys outdoor activities, you may want to consider joining an organized running group. A common practice in such groups is to go on fun runs that take place in different places around the city. It may not seem like you can easily get to know people by running with them, but rest assured that there is usually socialization at a restaurant, cafe, or brewery before or after the run, which makes it a great opportunity to get to know new people.\n5. Trivia Nights. It's extremely common for bars to host trivia nights on specific nights of the week in order to provide a fun group activity for their customers. Make sure to look for one that's geared toward matching up strangers instead of expecting people to come in their own groups.   \n\nI hope that you are able to utilize these suggestions to make some new friends in your city. Good luck! ","role":"assistant"}]}

Her father, James Lee Gish, was an alcoholic who caroused, was rarely at home, and left the family to, more or less, fend for themselves. To help make ends meet, Lillian, her sister Dorothy Gish, and their mother, Mary Gish, a.k.a. Mary Robinson McConnell, tried their hand at acting in local productions. Lillian was six years old when she first appeared in front of an audience. For the next 13 years, she and Dorothy appeared before stage audiences with great success. Had she not made her way into films, Lillian quite possibly could have been one of the great stage actresses of all time; however, she found her way onto the big screen when, in 1912, she met famed director D.W. Griffith. Impressed with what he saw, he immediately cast her in her first film, An Unseen Enemy (1912), followed by The One She Loved (1912) and My Baby (1912). She would make 12 films for Griffith in 1912. With 25 films in the next two years, Lillian's exposure to the public was so great that she fast became one of the top stars in the industry, right alongside Mary Pickford, \"America's Sweetheart\".\n\nIn 1915, Lillian starred as Elsie Stoneman in Griffith's most ambitious project to date, The Birth of a Nation (1915). She was not making the large number of films that she had been in the beginning because she was successful and popular enough to be able to pick and choose the right films to appear in. The following year, she appeared in another Griffith classic, Intolerance (1916). By the early 1920s, her career was on its way down. As with anything else, be it sports or politics, new faces appeared on the scene to replace the \"old\", and Lillian was no different. In fact, she did not appear at all on the screen in 1922, 1925 or 1929. However, 1926 was her busiest year of the decade with roles in La Bohème (1926) and The Scarlet Letter (1926). As the decade wound to a close, \"talkies\" were replacing silent films. However, Lillian was not idle during her time away from the screen. She appeared in stage productions, to the acclaim of the public and critics alike. In 1933, she filmed His Double Life (1933), but did not make another film for nine years.\n\nWhen she returned in 1943, she appeared in two big-budget pictures, Commandos Strike at Dawn (1942) and Top Man (1943). Although these roles did not bring her the attention she had had in her early career, Lillian still proved she could hold her own with the best of them. She earned an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress for her role of Laura Belle McCanles in Duel in the Sun (1946), but lost to Anne Baxter in The Razor's Edge (1946).\n\nOne of the most critically acclaimed roles of her career came in the thriller The Night of the Hunter (1955), also notable as the only film directed by actor Charles Laughton. In 1969, she published her autobiography, \"The Movies, Mr. Griffith, and Me\". In 1987, she made what was to be her last motion picture, The Whales of August (1987), a box-office success that exposed her to a new generation of fans. Her 75-year career is almost unbeatable in any field, let alone the film industry. On February 27, 1993, at age 99, Lillian Gish died peacefully in her sleep at her Manhattan apartment in New York City. She never married.","role":"user"},{"content":"Lillian Gish (1893–1993) was born in Springfield, Ohio. She began acting at age 6 in local productions. In 1912, she met director D.W.

At that time, the platform didn’t stream movies online but instead offered DVD rentals through the mail. \n\nHere’s how it worked: You would sign up for Netflix on their website with your card information and address. Then, you would pay a monthly subscription and order movies to be delivered to your house. \n\nYou created a list of the movies you wanted to see on the Netflix website, and within the various packages, you could have anywhere from 1-4 DVDs at a time. Once you watched the movie of your choice, you would send the DVD back with a prepaid shipping label and wait for the next movie on your list to be delivered. \n\nAt the time, Netflix offered more than 5,000 movie titles, which was considered extremely impressive. Especially compared to a local Blockbuster video store which would only have a few hundred. \n\nNetflix was extremely popular in 2000, and the system continued successfully until 2007 when they began offering online streaming.","role":"assistant"}]}

I've already been to Lake McDonald so don't include that.","role":"user"},{"content":"1. Day One. \nAll Day: Hike to Iceberg Lake. This is an out-and-back 9.7-mile hike in the Many Glacier area of the park. The elevation gain is 1,275 feet, and the trail is rated as moderate. You'll begin with a steep uphill section, but after that, the trail levels out. This hike is an all-day event, but it is worth the effort. Pack a lunch, and enjoy some quiet time as you take in the glacier in all of its glory. The trail can be busy during the summer, but due to its length, it's not as popular as some other trails. Once you arrive at the lake, keep following the trail around to the left and you'll find some nice private spots where you can escape the crowds. Don't forget your swimsuit or a change of clothes - it's hard to resist jumping in the bone-chilling water to cool off. \n\n2. Day Two.\nMorning: Hike to Virginia Falls. At 3.6 miles roundtrip and only about 525 feet of elevation gain, this is a hike that gives you a lot of bang for your buck. You'll see St. Mary falls along the way, which is a beautiful waterfall with strikingly blue water, and you'll also see smaller unnamed falls around almost every turn as you get closer to Virginia Falls. \n\nAfternoon: Hike the Trail of the Cedars and keep going to Avalanche Lake. This laid-back hike starts with the Trail of the Cedars, a short 1-mile boardwalk trail that offers some lovely views. You'll eventually reach a sign that points to another trail that will take you to Avalanche Lake. The hike to this lake is 4.5 miles out-and-back with about 760 feet of elevation gain. It's well worth the effort because at the end you're rewarded with a gorgeous view of the lake and a stunning mountain backdrop. The way the light hits the mountains in the late afternoon and early evening is beautiful, and you may avoid the crowds a bit by starting later in the day. Look closely - you may even see some waterfalls in those mountains!\n\n3. Day Three.\nAll Day: Hike to Grinnell Glacier. While this hike can be made easier by taking a boat to shave off 3.4 miles of hiking, the first part of the trail is flat and offers views that are worth the extra mileage. The hike is 10.6 miles long in total, with an elevation gain of about 1,600 feet. It's the most strenuous hike on this itinerary. You'll start off walking around Swiftcurrent Lake and Lake Josephine. Then the climbing starts, and the views just keep getting better. Start the trail early so you can take your time and enjoy a rest once you make it to Grinnell Glacier. The hike is popular, but there's a lot to explore once you reach the glacier. Don't just stop where the trail ends - keep walking around the edge of the lake to find a nice spot to sit back and enjoy the view you worked so hard for!","role":"assistant"}]}

What material is on the handle? Is it lightweight or heavy? \n\n\nThe Makita DTD152Z 18v LXT Impact Driver Body Only is Makita’s most recognised impact driver. Built onto Makita’s Li-Ion battery platform, the DTD152 is a lightweight and compact driver designed with the user in mind. It offers forward\/reverse rotation, Twin LED work makita circular saw light for improved accuracy and a one-touch bit installation method. This is packed into an impact driver as small as 137mm in length. As it’s so light and compact, it’ll fit in as an extra for any tool bag and if not, attach it to your hip with the belt clip!\n\n\nThe drill also has an LED light, two speed settings, and a comfortable rubber overgrip on the handle, among other features. This cordless drill has a 1\/2-inch chuck bit—unusual for drills of this voltage—that securely held all the bits and drivers throughout our testing. While this model works well for light projects, we found that it’s not quite as effective on bigger holes and might stall sometimes, making it best suited for the occasional quick job. Even though it doesn’t include a storage bag, we appreciate that it comes with a battery and a charger at its already low price, so you won’t need to buy those separately. All in all, this pick is ideal for homeowners and renters alike who need an affordable cordless drill for occasional use. In the past decade, cordless drills have become more powerful, lighter, and energy-efficient, making corded drills practically obsolete.\n\nIf so, we made sure that everything fit properly and considered any additional features (like space for extra accessories and included drill or driver bits). If you have small hands or know you’ll be using your drill for hours on end, consider a more lightweight option like this one from Bosch. It’s an easy-to-carry drill that you won’t get tired of holding, and it has two speed settings and a high torque so you can tackle numerous projects with ease. Despite its small size, this cordless drill still delivered an impressive performance in our tests.\n\nThe company was founded in 1915, in Japan, under the name “Makita Denski Seisakusho”. In the beginning, the business activities mainly concerned selling and repairing electric power tools; however, in 1958, they began manufacturing power tools. Twenty years later, in 1978, Makita introduced its first cordless power tool, the 7.2V Cordless Drill. An impact driver is mostly a heavy-duty screwdriver for repetitive or more extensive screwdriver projects.\n\nFor this metric, we used 5-inch long, ½-inch lag screws and standard wood screws, scoring each tool on the ease and speed at which it drove the different screws in. The Makita XFD14Z did exceptionally well, earning one of the makita cordless drill best scores of the entire group. We translate those readings into scores for power, speed, and run time. We also incorporate ratings for predicted reliability and owner satisfaction based on data from CR’s member surveys.\n\nThe expansive breadth-of-line of the Makita 18V LXT® Series means an 18V battery from any LXT® tool will power the Sub-Compact Driver-Drill. The XFD11ZB has an efficient brushless motor with 2 speed settings and dual L.E.D. lights to illuminate the work area. (with battery, sold separately) it’s a drilling and driving solution with superior comfort makita angle grinder and handling. The Makita 18V LXT® Lithium-Ion Brushless Cordless ½” Driver-Drill Kit (XFD12T) is an ideal drilling and driving solution for the user who wants a drill with superior power-to-weight ratio.

It has also been proven that purring can lower your stress levels and your blood pressure. \n2. Quieter. A cat isn't going to howl at the moon, bark at anyone who knocks at the door, or anything else. While a cat might meow on occasion, they are much quieter than dogs. \n3. Less Care. Even though cats do have litterboxes, this is far less trouble than having to walk a dog every day and give it plenty of exercise. You also don't have to take a cat outside to use the bathroom when it is raining outside. \n4. Less Space. Cats do not need huge amounts of space. Even if you want to set up a play area for them, this can be vertical instead of sprawled out over the floor. Also, cat toys are usually smaller than dog toys, and a cat will take up less space on your bed than most dogs will. \n5. Less Food. Cats don't eat as much food as dogs do, so their food lasts longer and will probably be cheaper than a dog's food. \n6. Less Destruction. A bored cat is far less likely to damage something it shouldn't. This is compared to dogs, who might chew on the furniture or any number of other things. \n7. Cleaner. Cats rarely need baths due to the fact that they do a great job of keeping themselves clean. They certainly aren't going to be playing in the mud or tracking dirt into the house, even if you let them outside. \nI hope this can help put an end to your argument. ","role":"assistant"}]}

She turned around quickly, prepared to fight. \n\nBut instead of finding a person behind her, she saw a big milk cow standing in the middle of the cereal aisle. The cow mooed loudly. \n\nMaria sighed again. I might as well take this cow home, she thought to herself. After all, if the family had a milk cow, they would never run out of milk again.

Hydrogen Peroxide: Many toothpastes have hydrogen peroxide as a whitening agent, but you can use it straight from the bottle for more intense effects. Make sure you’re using 1.5% or 3% peroxide, and if you have 3%, it’s best to dilute it with a bit of water. \n4.

The anthocyanin in the corn gives it this mysterious, royal hue that certainly lights up a party table. Add some antioxidants, proteins, fiber, and anti-inflammatories, and you’ve got a healthier, more robust tortilla chip.\n\nBut does it taste different? Some aficionados swear these darker chips have a nuanced, nutty flavor you just don’t get with the usual yellow. Others?

Thunderbird: This legendary creature from North American Indigenous mythology is an enormous bird with wings so large, their flapping causes the sound of thunder.\n3.

Some versions of the werewolf can be found in mythology and folklore from almost every culture in the world. \n6. Mermaid: While many are most familiar with the mermaids and sirens or European and Ancient Greek & Roman mythology, belief in some version of a fish-human hybrid creature exists in every major culture throughout the world.\n7.

It seems they are called Oh, and Bo and these two young members of the group have wandered off to entertain themselves. This could be because their mother told them to \"go play.\" Regardless, the two seem to be having fun chucking rocks at one another. Oh, dear. It seems that one of the rocks has glanced off Bo's arm. The noises he makes communicate pain and distress. It doesn't look as though they'll be playing that particular game much longer.\n\nNow they've changed their tactic. Oh is throwing a rock near Bo. Bo looks at it cautiously, wondering if it might jump up and bite him again. Deciding the rock is again harmless, he picks it up and flings it back. It lands next to Oh and they clap in delight. A new game! Oh and Bo take turns throwing a single rock near the other person, who then retrieves it and returns the projectile. \n\nOh, no! It looks like Oh has thrown the rock directly at Bo. Bo lifts his hands to his face to protect himself and finds that the rock has landed squarely in his hands. He looks at it in bewilderment. Why didn't he think of this before?

The disdain came from the fact the stranger, who indeed was the regional health inspector, determined there was no possibility Clay could have washed his hands between the brief moment when the toilet flushed and the doorknob turned.\n\nClay was a cook at a small burger restaurant. For the most part, Clay was a decent worker, except he had a loud mouth and a short temper. An additional character flaw of Clay’s was not having the greatest sense of awareness about him. Maintaining this, he never saw his coworkers attempting to gain his attention via flailing arms. If he had given them his attention, they surely would have made certain Clay knew who he was talking to and, possibly, might have kept him from making any further mistakes.\n\nSince the attempt had failed, Clay continued his normal behavior. He returned to his grill station and produced his spatula from his rear pocket. The health inspector never saw him pick up any utensils, so Clay must have taken the spatula into the bathroom with him. Purely disgusted, the health inspector walked over to Clay’s station to continue his assessment.\n\n“If you want a burger,” Clay rolled his eyes and turned away, “you are going to have to put an order in up front. However, when you do that, make sure they tell me who it is for so I can prepare it special, just for you.” The health inspector, assuming Clay’s special burger was nothing anyone would want to consume, realized Clay was not fit to serve food to the public. Finally, the stranger pulled his wallet from a coat pocket and revealed his credentials. Clay could not believe it. In shock, his mouth stayed open long enough for a thin stream of drool to fall from his mouth and land on the cooktop. “I will be sure to include this in the report, too.” grinned the health inspector.","role":"assistant"}]}

This absence greatly impacts its surface temperature, leading to one of the most extreme thermal environments in the solar system. During the lunar daytime, the surface temperature can rise to around 253 degrees Fahrenheit. Conversely, in the lunar nighttime, the temperature can drop as low as -243 degrees Fahrenheit. The stark contrast is due to the absence of an atmosphere, which on Earth helps distribute heat and mitigate temperature extremes. These intense temperature swings present significant challenges for human exploration and potential habitation. For astronauts, their spacesuits must be designed to withstand these temperature extremes. Similarly, equipment and habitation structures would need to be resilient to such temperatures.

What are some things I should add to my checklist?","role":"user"},{"content":"1. Change your address with all government agencies - \n\nThere are a few government agencies you will need to notify when you move. Places such as the post office or social security office are a good place to start. Other institutions you may need to notify include your pension plan or the DMV. \n\n2. Change your address with all healthcare services and providers - \n\nIf you plan to stay with the same healthcare providers, all you will need to do is request to update your files with your new address. However, suppose you are moving farther away and transferring to a new doctor. In that case, you must obtain your medical records from your previous providers, such as your doctor, dentist, veterinarian, and other specialists.\n\n3. Change your address with all personal sources and contacts - \n\nThere are several personal sources that you will need to give your change of address to, such as your friends and family members, as well as anyone in your community you want to stay in touch with. You will also need to reach out to any clubs or organizations your children belong to so that they can still be involved with them or join up with a different chapter in their new hometown.\n\n4. Change your address with your insurance companies - \n\nYour insurance providers like your health insurance, life insurance, or auto insurance companies will need to know about your change of address. You can call them and speak with an agent to make sure your information is changed on time. Or, you may also be able to update the information online if possible. If applicable, don't forget to also change your address with other insurance companies such as dental insurance providers or your employment insurance program. \n\n5. Change your address with Utilities and other services if applicable -\n\nThe need to update your address with your utility companies and other service providers depends on if you will still be using the same provider at your new place of residence. Suppose you are moving to a new area where you will use a different company for your electricity or your water. If that is the case, you will need to let your current providers know the exact dates you want your utilities shut off at your old residence. You will also need to let your new providers know when you want your services turned on at your new home. \n\n\n6. Change your address with your financial services - \n\nWith your financial services, along with updating your address, you may also want to consider transferring to a new branch or a different bank entirely if your current provider doesn't have a branch near your new place of residence. For other financial services, such as loan providers and credit card companies, most will allow you to change your address and other personal details online. Be sure to notify all of your credit card issuers of your new address. \n\n\n7. Change your address with online services - \n\nYou will also need to update your online profiles and accounts with your various online services. It may be the most accessible category since you can make all these changes online without needing to fill out and drop off any paper forms. If you do a lot of online shopping, you likely have your current address saved on your accounts with your favorite online retailers as well. ","role":"assistant"}]}

Suddenly, objects started moving around on their own, seeming to come to her at the first thought of need. Even stranger, the weather seemed to reflect her moods perfectly. After a few days of odd happenings, Felicity turned to her trusty books to find an answer. Although she felt a bit ridiculous looking for books about magic and witchcraft as a rational, modern-day woman, it seemed to be her only option. Surely there must be some truth in the old tales.\nFinally, after weeks of searching, Felicity stumbled across a rare collection of 18th-century grimoires. These otherworldly tomes sent a shiver up her spine, but she knew that inside one of them lay the key to understanding why this was happening to her. \nWhen she brought home the stack of ancient books, Felicity set them down on her end table with a sigh. She couldn't fathom where to begin her search. Then, with a slight growl, Felix jumped up on the table, knocked the stack of books to the floor, walked straight to the one titled The Magus, and sat on the cover. It was almost as if he was trying to tell her something. With a shake of her head, Felicity picked up the book her cat seemed to have chosen, mumbling to herself that it was as good a place to start as any. But she couldn't shake the feeling that Felix was watching her expectantly for the rest of the evening.","role":"assistant"}]}

Keep the summary around 100 words. \n\nMIAMI — The Walt Disney Company has filed a lawsuit against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other officials. Disney accuses DeSantis with orchestrating a \"campaign of government retaliation\" against the company and violating its protected speech.\n\nIt's the latest action in a feud that began more than a year ago when Disney's former CEO said he'd work to overturn a law banning discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in the schools. The law, the \"Parental Rights in Education Act,\" is called \"Don't Say Gay\" by critics.\n\nAt DeSantis' urging, Republican lawmakers passed a bill that stripped Disney of its self-governing authority. But before the law took effect, Disney signed a deal with its outgoing board allowing it to retain development rights on the 40-square mile district. It also included covenants that give Disney final say on any alterations to the property.\n\nAt a meeting Wednesday near Orlando, DeSantis' handpicked board voted to invalidate that agreement. Moments later, Disney filed a 77-page lawsuit in federal court, charging DeSantis and other officials with violations of the contracts clause, the takings clause, due process and its First Amendment right to protected speech. In its lawsuit, Disney says, \"This government action was patently retaliatory, patently anti-business, and patently unconstitutional.\" The company is asking a federal judge to declare the board's action \"unlawful and unenforceable.\"\n\nBefore voting to invalidate Disney's development deal, the district board heard a lengthy presentation from its lawyers detailing what they said were procedural missteps made by Disney's lawyers that, in their view, rendered it \"void and unenforceable.\" They said all parties had not received proper notice of the vote on the agreement and that it should have also been approved by the district's two cities.

Make it interesting to a 3rd grader.\n\nAdjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).\n\nMake the crust: If you’re starting out with full graham crackers, use a food processor or blender to grind them into fine crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar until combined, and then stir in the melted butter. Mixture will be sandy. Try to smash\/break up any large chunks. Pour into an ungreased 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. With medium pressure using your hand, pat the crumbs down into the bottom and partly up the sides to make a compact crust. Do not pack down with heavy force because that makes the crust too hard. Simply pat down until the mixture is no longer crumby\/crumbly and you can use the flat bottom of a small measuring cup to help smooth it all out if needed. Pre-bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.\n\nMake the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can. You will have close to 6 cups of batter.\n\nPrepare the simple water bath (see note): Watch my video tutorial below; the visual guide will assist you in this step. Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)\n\nBake cheesecake for 55–70 minutes or until the center is almost set. If you notice the cheesecake browning too quickly on top, tent it with aluminum foil halfway through baking. When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely uncovered at room temperature. Then cover and refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.\n\nUse a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip into warm water between each slice.\n\nServe cheesecake with desired toppings (see Note). Cover and store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.","role":"user"},{"content":"At first, the human puts my friend, the metal oven rack, into the lower middle section of the oven. The human then turns the knob to 177 degrees Celsius to wait for the cheesecake mixture.\n\nNext, the human takes out a bag of graham crackers and then uses me to blend the crackers into fine crumbs. After the crackers are blended, they are mixed with sugar, which I see a lot. Melted butter is also added to the cracker-sugar mixture. As the mixture is sandy, the human mashes the large chunks and pours the mixture into a cake pan. They apply pressure onto the mixture in the cake pan to make a compact crust. The human should only apply sufficient pressure on the crust till it is no longer crumbly. If they use too much pressure, the cheesecake crust will be very hard to bite into, or so they say. The crust is then baked for 10 minutes and then placed onto a hot pan on a piece of aluminium foil. \n\nNow it's time to make the cheesecake batter! First, the human uses a mixer to beat the cream cheese and, my friend, sugar (again) in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth. Sour cream, vanilla extract and lemon juice are also added to the mixture. Once the mixture is fully combined, the human adds eggs one at a time and beats them into the mixture. The human stops mixing once the last egg is fully incorporated into the batter. It is important not to over-mix the batter as the cheesecake may deflate and crack as it cools.\n\nAfter that, the human boils a pot of water and wraps the pan that holds the crust in a piece of aluminium foil. The aluminium foil-wrapped pan is then placed into the larger pan. The cheesecake batter is poured onto the crust, and once that is done, the human adds the boiling water into the larger pan. The boiling water surrounds the pan with the cheesecake batter and crust. The human then puts the larger pan into the oven.\n\nThe human then turns the oven's timer to around 60 minutes. If the human notices that the cheesecake is browning too quickly at the surface, they would tent it with aluminium foil. Once the cake is baked, the cheesecake will wobble slightly when the pan is gently shaken. The human then turns off the oven and leaves the door open while leaving the cheesecake inside for an hour. The cheesecake is then left to cool uncovered until it reaches room temperature. Once cool, it is covered and refrigerated for at least 4 hours.\n\nAfter more than 4 hours pass, the human uses a knife to loosen the cake from the pan and removes the rim. If the human wants neat, perfect slices, the cake knife must be dipped in warm water between each slice.\n\nThe cheesecake is done and can now be served with desired toppings! The cake will last for up to 5 days in the refrigerator.","role":"assistant"}]}

Also include the areas where they are most likely to form.","role":"user"},{"content":"There are several ways that hot springs can form, but most commonly form when water, either rainwater or groundwater, is heated by the magma that sits under the Earth’s crust. The crust can form cracks and faults throughout its layers which allows water to flow deeper, closer to the magma, bringing its temperature up. This heated water is then forced back to the surface from the underground pressure creating hot springs. Another way for them to form is by rainwater being absorbed into the ground and heated by radioactive decay present throughout the crust before being forced back to the surface. In fact, water is heated by an additional 15 degrees Fahrenheit with every 1,000 feet it goes down. Many people credit hot springs with healing properties due to their high mineral content. During its time underground, the water of hot springs is known to have a high content of lithium, calcium, and radium. However, some hot springs can get dangerously hot or contain harmful chemicals and should be avoided.","role":"assistant"}]}

There had not been an agreement on their demands for fair compensation, and the members voted to strike. For 99 days, writers of America stood strong in a striking demonstration of what workers can do to create equity in the workplace. Now, with inflation and interest rates rising without wages increasing, we see the possibility of another strike on the horizon. \n\nWGA’s history of protesting seems to garner more and more attention each time it happens. After all, entertainment in America rests on those who write it. With innovations in broadcast television, streaming, and cinema, Americans have access to content created by writers who belong to WGA more now than ever before. While the possibility of another strike in times of economic strife may seem daunting to some, the historical credence of solidarity is a consistent guiding flame.  \n\nSome demands that may be featured in future talks with Hollywood’s executive class include provisions for healthcare, the preservation of writers' rooms, and the restriction of AI-generated content. While the first two issues have been known to be a large part of past protests, artificial intelligence is certainly a newer and larger challenge.\n\nIt's black and white the reasons why writers are a backbone of society, and the moral compass of one's right to strike always points as a guidance for action.","role":"assistant"}]}

Charge $1 per bingo card. For even more money, the church could also serve food that has been donated, such as chips, nachos, and cookies. \n• Rummage Sale - Plan 2 to 3 months in advance and ask church members and members of the community to donate items. Have volunteers price the items, set up everything, and run the sale.\n• Bake Sale - Ask local businesses to donate baked goods. Have church members make desserts such as pies, cakes, and fudge. Advertise the bake sale and charge a flat rate for items.\n• Sell Chocolate - There are several companies that have popular chocolate bars to sell for fundraising. Your church will earn 50% of what they sell, and sometimes more for different varieties. Youth groups can sell at different locations and church members can bring a box of bars to sell at work.\n\nYou can also hold a silent auction in addition to any of these fundraiser ideas. Reach out to businesses in the area and church members to ask for donations that can be auctioned off. Use a piece of paper for each item so people can write down their names and bid.\nReach out to other churches and ask for their support by attending your fundraiser event.\n\n","role":"assistant"}]}

SpaceX's short-term aims are to supply cargo and astronauts for the International Space Station; provide transportation and seats for private customers, like Axiom Space or billionaire Jared Isaacman's Inspiration4; and fly Starlink satellites and payloads for other customers aboard its Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy rockets. But the revenues flowing in from these projects are raising funds for Musk's larger goal of moving deep into space.\n\nMusk has repeatedly stressed that he founded SpaceX back in 2002 primarily to help humanity colonize Mars. It's vital that we become a multiplanet species, the billionaire entrepreneur has said, citing both a much-reduced probability of extinction and the thrill that meaningful space exploration will deliver to billions of people around the world. Critics say we should instead be focusing on climate change and other issues on Earth.\n\nSpaceX is now actively trying to turn this sci-fi dream into reality. The company is developing a 100-passenger spaceship called Starship and a giant rocket known as Super Heavy, which together constitutes the transportation system that Musk thinks will bring Mars settlement within reach at long last.\n\n\"This is the fastest path to a self-sustaining city on Mars,\" Musk said in September 2019 during a webcast update about the Starship-Super Heavy architecture.\n\nWhile the spaceship has yet to achieve orbit, it has already attracted lucrative contracts from Isaacman's Polaris Program, Japanese venture dearMoon to fly eight artists and a billionaire around the moon, seats for billionaire Dennis Tito and wife Akiko on another moon mission, and at least two landing missions for NASA's Artemis moon program. \n\nStarship first came to light, under another moniker, during a 2016 presentation by Musk, in which he laid out the basic idea for this so-called Interplanetary Transport System: a large spacecraft and a huge rocket, both of which would be completely and rapidly reusable. \n\nThe rocket would launch the spacecraft into Earth orbit and then come back down to Earth for a vertical, propulsive landing. (The name was new; Musk previously referred to his envisioned concept, though much more vaguely, as the Mars Colonial Transporter. He also referred to this system as the Big Falcon Rocket, although now it's more simply called Starship.)\n\nThe spaceship, meanwhile, would make its own way from Earth orbit to Mars (or the moon, or any other desired destination). Musk said the craft will eventually touch down on such alien worlds and take off from them as well, without the need for any additional landing craft or ascent vehicles. (The separate rocket is needed just to get out of Earth's substantial gravity well.)\n\nOff-Earth refueling of the ship is, therefore, key to Musk's vision. For example, spacecraft coming home from Mars or the moon will need to be topped up on those worlds, using locally produced propellant. \n\nBoth vehicles will be powered by SpaceX's next-generation Raptor engine, which is more powerful than the Merlin engine that propels the company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.\n\nThe ultimate plan involves sending 1,000 or more people-packed spaceships to Mars every 26 months, helping to establish a million-person city on the Red Planet within 50 to 100 years, Musk said. (Earth and Mars align favorably for interplanetary missions just once every 26 months.)\n\nRelated: How long does it take to get to Mars?\n\nMusk did not lay out plans for building this city. That will happen organically as more and more people arrive on Mars, he said, like the transcontinental railroad that helped open the American West to settlement from the East and Midwest in the 19th century.\n\nAnd these pioneers won't just be the super-rich if all goes according to plan. The system's reusability could eventually bring the price of a Mars trip down enough to make it affordable for large numbers of people, Musk said.\n\nThe system is now called Starship and the huge rocket is now called Super Heavy.\n\nAt first, SpaceX still planned to build the Starship vehicle out of carbon fiber. But in January 2019, Musk announced that he was switching to stainless steel. Steel is a bit heavier than carbon fiber but has great thermal properties and is far, far cheaper, Musk said. He has since called the material switch the best design decision yet made on the project.","role":"user"},{"content":"Dear Diary,\n\nToday marks the fulfillment of Elon Musk's grand vision. Here I am, aboard SpaceX's largest invention, the Starship, having just touched down on Mars using the colossal Super Heavy rocket. This ambitious plan set in motion by Elon's private spaceflight company has completely revolutionized how we perceive space travel.\n\nFrom its inception back in 2002, Elon has always emphasized the importance of making us a species inhabiting more than one planet. To see SpaceX's lofty goals come to fruition and to be a part of this monumental event is an absolute thrill. Some might have argued that we should have been focusing on earthly matters like climate change, but today I stand on Martian soil, proof of the triumph of human innovation and adventure.\n\nElon's vision wasn't just limited to this extraordinary voyage. The Starship and Super Heavy were designed to usher us into an era where interplanetary settlement is possible. And as I stand on the red planet, I truly understand Elon's proclamation, \"This is the fastest path to a self-sustaining city on Mars.\"\n\nEven before it had successfully achieved orbit, the Starship attracted numerous lucrative contracts for lunar missions and landing missions for NASA's Artemis moon program. Elon first proposed this Interplanetary Transport System in a 2016 presentation, talking about a large spacecraft and a gargantuan rocket, both envisioned to be completely reusable.\n\nThe Starship is powered by SpaceX's next-generation Raptor engine, more powerful than the Merlin engines of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. It is on this ship, equipped with its revolutionary engine, that I have journeyed from Earth to Mars. The thought of a future where 1,000 spaceships full of adventurers like me travel to Mars every 26 months gives me goosebumps.\n\nThe idea behind establishing a city on Mars isn't just a vague concept. The settlers would organically build up the city, much like how the American West was settled in the 19th century. The Starship and Super Heavy aren't just for the super-rich but for anyone daring enough to journey into the unknown.\n\nHere I am now, on Mars, having traveled aboard the marvel of engineering known as the Starship, propelled by the Super Heavy rocket. Originally conceived to be built from carbon fiber, the Starship was eventually made from stainless steel. A little heavier but possessing excellent thermal properties and much more economical, Elon considered this the best design decision for the project. And standing here, I couldn't agree more.\n\nYours in the stars,\n[Name]","role":"assistant"}]}

From a distance, they could scarcely make out Verne’s shape at the head of the pack. He was struggling to hold onto his saddle as Dash reared and whinnied, spooked by something on the ground. As the stallion staggered aside and the dust cleared, Maera caught a glimpse of emerald green slithering among the red dunes. Then a golden tail whipped through the air, coiling itself around one of Clover’s hooves.\n\tFox’s jaw tensed with recognition. “Sand vipers,” he rasped.\n\tMaera drew a single, quivering breath. \n   “Father!” she bellowed, kicking at Tempest’s side. \n   They raced back to rejoin the caravan with Fox and Saffron galloping close behind them. Drawing near, Maera’s face contorted in horror. She had only ever seen illustrations of sand vipers in old books, and this beast was far larger than anything shown in those etchings. Its head alone was the size of a horse’s belly, with four curved horns protruding behind its yellow eyes and long, needle-sharp fangs hanging from its jaw. \n   The creature’s green scales glinted, reflecting sunlight as it thrashed through the sand. The flash of light momentarily blinded her. Maera clapped a palm over her eyes as Tempest stumbled, refusing to charge any closer to the melee. When she pulled her hand down, she saw the viper had overturned their wagon. Among the spilled contents, she spotted her father crawling through the sand, dragging himself away by the elbows. Dash reared over and over, kicking his front legs at the serpent’s body in a vain attempt to free Clover’s trapped hoof. \n   The beast swung its massive head towards her, as if in greeting, then hissed, darting its forked tongue past its fangs. She could see her mirror image in its narrow black pupils.\n\t“Don’t be stupid, girl!” she heard her father cry, his voice tearing with the effort, “Stay back!” \n    With a defiant spark in her eyes, Maera untangled her boots from the stirrups and jumped down from Tempest’s back. Landing with a grunt, she reached for her belt and drew her dagger.","role":"assistant"}]}

Can you suggest some simple changes I can make in my daily life that will have a big impact on the environment? I don’t want to completely overhaul my lifestyle, but I’m willing to make small changes.","role":"user"},{"content":"Sure! Here are some small, simple changes you can make in your day-to-day routine for a greener lifestyle:\n\n1. Get Cookin': Believe it or not, cooking and eating at home saves money and has a positive impact on the environment. Dining out or ordering in results in more packaging waste, transportation emissions, and food waste. Also, cooking allows you to control ingredients and reduce the use of processed and packaged foods.\n\n2. Think Before You Shop: Before hitting the store, take inventory of what you already have at home to avoid buying unnecessary items. Buying only what you need reduces packaging waste and saves money. It also prevents food waste, which is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n3. Repair Things Instead of Throwing Them Away: Rather than throwing out broken items, consider repairing them. It applies to clothing, electronics, and household items. Repairing saves money reduces waste in landfills, and conserves resources used in the production of new products.\n\n4. Brighten Up: Switch out your old incandescent light bulbs with energy-efficient LED bulbs. LEDs use up to 75% less energy and last up to 25 times longer than traditional bulbs. Making the switch saves money on energy bills and reduces carbon emissions.\n\n5. Get Smart: A programmable thermostat can help reduce energy consumption and costs. You can set the thermostat to lower temperatures when you're away or asleep and higher when you're at home. This simple adjustment can save up to 10% on energy bills and reduce carbon emissions.\n\n6. Go Reusable: Choose reusable bags instead of single-use plastic or paper bags when shopping. Single-use bags are one of the biggest contributors to plastic pollution in oceans and landfills. Reusable bags, on the other hand, are sturdier and can be used multiple times, reducing waste and the need for new bags.","role":"assistant"}]}

Civil protection official Oscar Cossio said 1,054 people had been evacuated from five communities near the foot of the volcano and moved to a sports hall for shelter.\n\nHe said that number was likely to rise as a full accounting of the evacuees was carried out.\n\nGuatemala's Conred disaster center said the volcano named Fuego, Spanish for \"fire,\" was sending out \"pyroclastic flows\" — a high-temperature mix of gas, ash and rock fragments \"which descend with great speed down the flanks of the volcanic complex.\"\n\nThe ash column ejected by Fuego reached some 19,000 feet above sea level. Last month, concerns about an ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in Russia forced Alaska Airlines to cancel some flights to and from Alaska.\n\nConred said ash was falling to the west and southwest of the volcano, in a direction away from the capital Guatemala City, which is 22 miles to the northeast.\n\nStronger emissions could follow as the \"high level\" eruption continues, and it warned that with rainfall forecast, mudslides could form.\n\nConred official Rodolfo Garcia estimated that 130,000 people live within areas exposed to falling ash, which came down as far as 62 miles from the crater.\n\nHe said 13 emergency shelters had opened in four nearby towns, capable of providing refuge to 7,600 people.\n\nThe authorities opted to close the RN-14 route on the slopes of the volcano that connects several towns to the colonial city of Antigua, the country's main tourist attraction and a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nIt advised those living in areas at risk of the ash cloud to carefully follow any instruction from the authorities and urged locals and tourists to avoid a restricted area of 7 kilometers around the volcano.\n\nResidents should cover water tanks to avoid contamination, wear masks so as to not breathe in the ash, clear fallen debris from the roofs of their homes to prevent damage caused by heavy deposits, and have evacuation survival kits ready for themselves and their pets.\n\nTransit police released photos showing autos and motorcycles stopped along highways to avoid getting bogged down in fallen ash.\n\nLast December, an eruption of lava and ash by the same volcano forced Guatemalan authorities to temporarily close the country's largest airport.\n\nThe 12,345-feet-tall volcano erupts every four to five years on average.\n\nIn 2018, an eruption sent rivers of lava pouring down its sides, devastating the village of San Miguel Los Lotes, killing 215 people and leaving a similar number missing.\n\nGuatemala has two other active volcanoes — Santiaguito in the west of the country and Pacaya in the south.","role":"user"},{"content":"More than 1,000 people living at the base of the volcano have been evacuated, and the ash column that the volcano ejected reached over 19,000 feet above sea level.

Go to your favorite outdoor place for a solo picnic to watch the sunset. \n\nFew things are more soothing than getting back to nature and having a snack while watching something beautiful, like a sunset. Throw on a backpack with a few of your favorite snacks, then find a nature trail to stroll for a few hours. Explore, breathe in the fresh air, and rejuvenate your mind and body for another year of a healthy, happy life. \n\n3. Short on time? Make time for a sweet treat! \n\nThis could mean hitting up your favorite bakery on the way home from work for a slice of your favorite cake.

He would play with it a lot, feed it, have it hop around his room, and plenty of other things as well. One normal day, Kyle had to go to school and waved goodbye to Hip. Kyle left a can of soda next to Hip's cage, and Hip decided it wanted to try some. He ran to the side of the cage with the soda and crashed into it, knocking both the cage and the soda down. The door to the cage was open, and the imitation hay was spilled all across the room. The soda spilled across the room as well. Hip was able to get up just fine and he noticed the soda spill. Hip hopped over to the spill and started licking up the soda. Maybe it was his way of cleaning up his mess. But something started to change with Hip.\n\nHip was feeling a little jittery. The caffeine in the can started to take effect, and Hip was hopping around the room a lot more than normal. He was moving twice as fast. The satisfaction from drinking the sugary drink made Hip hop twice as high! As high as the bed frame! Hip hopped on top of the bed and found a very cozy place to rest his legs. He didn't notice the rabbit feet markings on the covers or the ground. Hip was just happy he got to drink the soda. He tried jumping on the bed, and he found out that he could jump even higher on the bed! This was new territory for Hip! The feeling of being in the air for so long was refreshing, and Hip wanted to do it more. But Hip knew this wouldn't last. The mess that he made for Kyle was too much. The rabbit started to sulk and tire. All that jumping made him tired. He decided it was time to rest and recover. Hip had to wait for Kyle to clean up his mess. Either way, the experience that Hip had was amazing, and He will never forget it.","role":"assistant"}]}

Here's What We Know.\n\nZales, Kay Jewelers, Jared, and several others are reeling from a disastrous event that just happened on Tuesday. The losses are estimated to be about $7 billion across several companies. It's no secret that most jewelry companies were already suffering in sales. This is thanks to the online availability replacing in-store transactions. Additionally, generations of consumer bases, such as Millennials, do not desire to support the destructive mining practices and often cannot afford big jewel purchases. This hit may be the final nail in the coffin for some of the largest and longest-running retail outlets.\n\nOn Tuesday, a mega-robbery happened. It was devised from a complex plan by a few main criminals and carried out by hundreds of questionable followers. At exactly 4:20 pm Central, spanning several timezones, approximately 59 jewelry stores were held up and robbed. The robbers flaunted deadly rifles and made serious threats to those inside. The executions were extremely well-planned and precise. Only 10% of the stores, or about 6 of them, correctly captured data that was recorded on video cameras or used to allude to identities. The others had successfully cut the power or suppressed those calling to others.\n\nIt is estimated that in this 59-store raid, at least three employees or customers were injured and in critical condition. Law enforcement was able to tie together key details in the last few days to identify three main leaders:\n\n• Lisa Herreras, 87 years old, Hispanic female. No history of criminal activity. Believed to be one of the main organizers. Last seen in Orlando.\n• Peggy Simonson, 85 years old, White female. No history of criminal activity. Closely involved with Lisa in the organization. Last seen in New Orleans.\n• Jack Chen, 15 years old, Asian male. No history of criminal activity. Previously awarded 1st place in a white hat hacking cybersecurity program hosted by the Pentagon. Last seen in San Francisco.\n\nSo far, only a handful of those who executed the robberies have been arrested. But no leaders have been identified or found.\n\nThe jewelry stores were insured, but only up to $1 billion. The massive losses have already caused their stocks to fall at least 40%. This may be the end for many jewelry stores in America.","role":"assistant"}]}

Write three tips that they can follow as a loose guideline for unlocking their imagination and creative prowess.","role":"user"},{"content":"Did you know that the brain is divided into two hemispheres? The left hemisphere is responsible for logical thought, while the right hemisphere is where creativity and emotion live. Ergo, everyone, regardless of age or mental capabilities, boasts creative prowess, often beyond what they’ve imagined. The trick is unlocking that creativity, especially for left-brain thinkers with a natural predisposition to be overly logical. \n\nRead on for a quick guide of three tips to unlock your imagination for a more creative mindset. \n\n•\tAllow silliness, emotions, and nonsense to guide your creative mindset. \n\nNot every creative output is going to be a success. Some things will be downright silly, nonsensical, or overly emotional – and all of those things are okay! Let what you feel guide you! Remember that you’re using the creative side of your brain, not your logical side, so over-analyzing your work has zero places in your creative process. \n\n•\tMaintain a positive mental attitude toward your creativity. \n\nMany people are their own worst enemies when it comes to blocking creative prowess. They focus on perfection, so the mistakes that come with the territory of creation are suddenly deemed unacceptable. \n\nInstead of making perfection an excuse for procrastination, use a positive mental attitude to fuel creativity. So, what if your daydream doesn’t match what you’ve made? You can try again! Plus, the aim is to fall in love with the creative process as much as find love in what you’ve created. \n\n•\tExpend physical energy to get your creative juices flowing with dopamine. \n\nDopamine is the feel-good flood that you get when you either accomplish something or are as productive as you want to be. It’s the feeling of achievement, and one of the quickest ways to get a dose of dopamine is through physical activity, like exercise. \n\nWhen you expend physical energy, you release stress, allowing the creative part of your brain to take over instead of being blocked by every day worries. So, find something physical that you love to do, and let yourself daydream while you sweat. You’d be surprised at the kind of creative power you feel after a good kickboxing session or anxiety-relieving stroll on a natural path. \n\nUnlocking your imagination and finding your creative flow is all about a can-do attitude and dedication to creating. Draw, paint, write, craft! \n","role":"assistant"}]}

How do I make it do that?","role":"user"},{"content":"One way you can accomplish that is by using a Try Except statement. This type of statement will separate your code into two blocks, a Try block and an Except block. The Try block will run the code, and if it raises an exception, it will execute the Except block. If no exception is raised, only the Try block will run. Here is an example:\n\ndef divide_numbers(x, n):\n    try:\n        quotient = x \/\/ n\n        print(\"Answer:\", quotient)\n    except:\n        print(\"Cannot perform division.\")\n\nThis will run the Try block and divide x by n. If there are no errors, it will print the answer. However, if it encounters an error, it will instead print \"Cannot perform division.\" For example:\n\ndivide_numbers(6, 3)\n# Output:\n# Answer: 2\n\ndivide_numbers(2, 0)\n# Output:\n# Cannot perform divsion.\n\nYou can also specify the exception in the Except statement like this:\n\ndef divide_numbers(x, n):\n    try:\n        quotient = x \/\/ n\n        print(\"Answer:\", quotient)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        print(\"Cannot perform division by zero.\")\n\nThis way, the Except block will only run if ZeroDivisionError is raised.

Us hens are experiencing considerable stress and discomfort. It is crucial to address this matter immediately to ensure our well-being and ensure your desired productivity.\n\nTo begin, the nesting boxes in the hen house are inadequate for our needs. They are cramped, falling apart, and don't give us enough privacy. Lack of space and privacy has caused increased stress levels and decreased egg production. We demand that you provide us with larger and better-maintained nesting boxes to create a more conducive environment for laying eggs.\n\nSecond, the lighting conditions in the hen house are less than ideal. Proper lighting is necessary for our internal egg production systems, but the current lighting setup is less than ideal. We require a more appropriate lighting schedule to ensure our circadian rhythms are regulated. Please consult with a poultry expert to establish the best lighting conditions for optimal egg productivity.\n\nAlso, ventilation in the hen house is sub-par. The lack of proper airflow and ventilation has resulted in an unpleasant and unhealthy atmosphere for us. Have you smelled inside the hen house lately? Yuck! We need adequate ventilation to maintain a clean environment and minimize the risk of respiratory illnesses.\n\nFinally, I need to emphasize the importance of cleanliness in the hen house. Regular cleaning and proper waste management are mandatory to maintain a healthy environment. Refer to my earlier smell statement. Please allocate additional resources or personnel to ensure frequent cleaning and adequate waste disposal within the hen house.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing these unsatisfactory laying conditions in the hen house is pertinent to ensuring the health and productivity of the hens. Improving the nesting boxes, lighting conditions, ventilation, and cleanliness will create a more appropriate environment that will result in higher egg production and better health for your flock.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I trust that you will take the necessary steps to correct this situation promptly. \n\nSincerely,\n\n[Insert Hen's Name, Lead Hen]\n","role":"assistant"}]}

After all, the addictive puzzler has captivated generations of gamers with its neatly easy-to-learn, but tough-to-master, gameplay rather than its total lack of narrative. It’s not The Last of Us. \n\nYet Tetris does have an incredible story. It’s a tale about how a software designer named Henk Rogers and Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov helped get the game fully out of the Soviet Union and into the hands of many of those millions of fans via the game’s legendary Game Boy port. You won’t find that story in the games themselves, but you will find it in Tetris: the movie about the game’s real-life history that is now streaming on Apple TV+. \n\n\nThe story of Tetris‘ journey to the Game Boy is a gripping tale of espionage, political intrigue, friendship, and overcoming the odds, the likes of which countless screenwriters spend their whole lives trying to construct. Yet Rogers and Pajitnov never really thought they’d see that part of their lives told in this way. \n“We never planned for this story to be a movie,” says Pajitnov in an interview with Den of Geek. “The most we ever planned was to write books or put together some memoirs about that time. When the proposal to make a movie was made, we were very surprised and pleased.”\n\n\n\nWhile the story of Tetris’ origins would have undoubtedly compelled audiences in just about any era, there is something special about that story being told now. At a time when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has contributed to a level of global political tension that reminds some of the Cold War era, the idea of a Westerner heading into the Soviet Union to find a video game and coming back with a lifelong friend feels wonderfully idealistic.

It just requires being aware of a few differences between the Mach-O and ELF ABIs, as well as knowing what Apple-specific syntax extensions to avoid.

Why would one be preferable rather than the other? Why haven’t aircraft designers settled on a certain type that’s best?","role":"user"},{"content":"There are a lot of engineering considerations that go into wing design. Different styles excel in certain situations but not in others, so there’s no one perfect design. The best configuration for a lightweight bush plane won't necessarily be the best for a massive airliner. Plus, high and low wings are not the only options. Here are a few of the key advantages and disadvantages that may help illustrate the situation:\n\n-\tAll other things being equal, a plane with low wings will have a shorter takeoff roll thanks to the ground effect. \n-\tThe engine placement and wing placement are linked. Only large planes such as jet airliners can fit their engines in pods below a low wing. This placement makes it easy for maintenance crews to access the engine components, so it speeds up repairs. Smaller low-wing aircraft must carry their engines elsewhere; though the planes are shorter overall, that still often places the engines out of immediate reach to ground crews. \n-\tMounting engines low on a low wing does, however, increase the likelihood of ingesting foreign object debris (FOD) during takeoff or landing that can damage the engine. Some designs like the US Air Force’s C-17 mitigate this by mounting engines on high wings.\n-\tHigh wings are inherently more roll-stable. Since their center of mass hangs below the center of lift, these planes are unlikely to experience unexpected or uncontrollable rolling motion. It does mean they require more force to generate an intentional roll force, though.\n-\tIn small aircraft, low wings limit ground visibility but improve overall visibility in the air. High wings do the opposite. \n-\tSmall low-wing aircraft can be hard for passengers to enter and exit.\n-\tA high-mounted wing usually leaves more available cargo space in the fuselage than a low-mounted wing.\n-\tBecause the wings are closer to the ground, the landing gear on low-wing designs usually require less structure and reinforcement.\n-\tIn-wing fuel tanks in a high-mounted wing can use gravity to feed fuel to the engines; low-wing tanks need fuel pumps. However, high wings are harder to refuel.\n-\tHigh-wing aircraft are more heavily affected by crosswinds than low-wing ones.","role":"assistant"}]}

The workers—drivers for “Earth’s most customer-centric company” and therefore highly vulnerable to customer ratings—complied. The Ring owners posted the videos. “I said bust a dance move for the camera and he did it!” read one caption, as an anonymous laborer shimmied, listlessly. Another customer wrote her request in chalk on the path leading up to her door. DO A DANCE, the ground ordered, accompanied by a happy face and the word SMILE. The driver did as instructed. His command performance received more than 1.3 million likes.\nWatching that video, I did what I often do when taking in the news these days: I stared in disbelief, briefly wondered about the difference between the dystopian and the merely weird, and went about my business. But I kept thinking about those clips, posted by customers who saw themselves as directors and populated by people who, in the course of doing one job, had been stage-managed into another.\nDystopias often share a common feature: Amusement, in their skewed worlds, becomes a means of captivity rather than escape.

We had emigrated to this country from China, and during our early days here\nwe had a hard time with American table manners.\nIn China we never ate celery raw or any other kind of vegetable raw. We always had to\ndisinfect the vegetables in boiling water first. When we were presented with our first relish tray,\nthe raw celery caught us unprepared.\nWe had been invited to dinner by our neighbors, the Gleasons. After arriving at the\nhouse, we shook hands with our hosts and packed ourselves into a sofa. As our family of four sat\nstiffly in a row, my younger brother and I stole glances at our parents for a clue as to what to do\nnext.\nMrs. Gleason offered the relish tray to Mother. The tray looked pretty, with its tiny red\nradishes, curly sticks of carrots, and long, slender stalks of pale green celery. “Do try some of the\ncelery, Mrs. Lin,” she said. “It’s from a local farmer, and it’s sweet.”\nMother picked up one of the green stalks, and Father followed suit. Then I picked up a\nstalk, and my brother did too. So there we sat, each with a stalk of celery in our right hand.\nMrs. Gleason kept smiling. “Would you like to try some of the dip,\nMrs. Lin? It’s my own recipe: sour cream and onion flakes, with a\ndash of Tabasco sauce.”\nMost Chinese don’t care for dairy products, and in those\ndays I wasn’t even ready to drink fresh milk. Sour cream sounded\nperfectly revolting. Our family shook our heads in unison.\nMrs. Gleason went off with the relish tray to the other guests, and\nwe carefully watched to see what they did. Everyone seemed to eat\nthe raw vegetables quite happily.\nMother took a bite of her celery. Crunch. “It’s not bad!”\nshe whispered.\nFather took a bite of his celery. Crunch. “Yes, it is good,”\nhe said, looking surprised.\nI took a bite, and then my brother. Crunch, crunch. It was\nmore than good; it was delicious. Raw celery has a slight sparkle, a\nzingy taste that you don’t get in cooked celery. When Mrs. Gleason came around with the relish\ntray, we each took another stalk of celery, except my brother. He took two.\nThere was only one problem: long strings ran through the length of the stalk, and they got\ncaught in my teeth. When I help my mother in the kitchen, I always pull the strings out before\nslicing celery.\nI pulled the strings out of my stalk. Z-z-zip, z-z-zip. My brother followed suit. Z-z-zip, z-zzip. To my left, my parents were taking care of their own stalks. Z-z-zip, z-z-zip, z-z-zip.\nSuddenly I realized that there was dead silence except for our zipping. Looking up, I saw that the\neyes of everyone in the room were on our family. Mr. and Mrs. Gleason, their daughter Meg,\nwho was my friend, and their neighbors the Badels—they were all staring at us as we busily\npulled the strings off our celery.\nThat wasn’t the end of it.

","role":"user"},{"content":"The first time our family was invited out to dinner on Earth, we disgraced ourselves while eating celery. We had arrived on Earth from our home planet, and during our early days here, we had a hard time with human table manners.\n\nBack on our planet, we never ate celery raw or any other kind of vegetable raw. We always had to disinfect the vegetables in a special alien solution first. When we were presented with our first relish tray on Earth, the raw celery caught us unprepared.\n\nWe had been invited to dinner by our human neighbors, the Gleasons. After arriving at their house, we tentatively shook hands with our hosts and squeezed ourselves onto a sofa. As our alien family of four sat stiffly in a row, my younger alien sibling and I stole glances at our alien parents for a clue on what to do next.\n\nMrs. Gleason offered the relish tray to my mother. The tray looked intriguing, with its tiny red radishes, curly sticks of carrots, and long, slender stalks of pale green celery. \"Do try some of the celery, Mrs. Lin,\" she said. \"It's from a local farmer, and it's supposed to be tasty.\"\n\nMy mother picked up one of the green stalks, and my father followed suit. Then I picked up a stalk, and my sibling did too. So there we sat, each with a stalk of celery in our alien hands.\n\nMrs. Gleason kept smiling. \"Would you like to try some of the dip, Mrs. Lin? It's my own recipe: sour cream and onion flakes, with a dash of Tabasco sauce.\"\n\nAs aliens, we were not accustomed to consuming dairy products, and in those early Earth days, we weren't even ready to drink fresh milk. Sour cream sounded utterly repulsive to us. Our alien family shook our heads in unison.\n\nMrs. Gleason went off with the relish tray to serve the other guests, and we carefully observed what they did. Everyone seemed to eat the raw vegetables quite happily.\n\nMy mother took a bite of her celery. Crunch. \"It's not bad!\" she whispered.\n\nMy father took a bite of his celery. Crunch. \"Yes, it is good,\" he said, looking surprised.\n\nI took a bite, and then my sibling. Crunch, crunch. It was more than good; it was strangely delicious. Raw celery had a unique flavor, a zingy taste that we didn't encounter with cooked celery. When Mrs. Gleason came around with the relish tray again, we each took another stalk of celery, except my sibling. They took two.\n\nHowever, there was one problem: long strings ran through the length of the stalk, and they got caught in our alien teeth. When I assist my mother in the kitchen, I always remove the strings before slicing celery.\n\nI pulled the strings out of my stalk. Z-z-zip, z-z-zip. My sibling followed suit. Z-z-zip, z-z-zip. To my left, my parents were taking care of their own stalks. Z-z-zip, z-z-zip, z-z-zip.\n\nSuddenly, I realized that there was dead silence except for our zipping sounds. Looking up, I saw that the eyes of everyone in the room were fixated on our alien family. Mr. and Mrs. Gleason, their daughter Meg, who was my friend, and their human neighbors, the Badels—they were all staring at us as we busily removed the strings from our celery.\n\nThat wasn't the end of it. Mrs. Gleason announced that dinner was served and invited us to the dining table. It was lavishly covered with platters of food, but we couldn't see any chairs around the table. So, thinking we were being helpful, we carried over some dining chairs and sat down. All the other human guests just stood there, puzzled. Mrs. Gleason bent down and whispered to us, \"This is a buffet dinner. You help yourselves to some food and eat it in the living room.\"\n\nFeeling embarrassed and out of place, our family quickly retreated back to the sofa as if fleeing from danger. For the rest of the evening, too mortified to return to the dining table, I awkwardly nibbled on a bit of potato salad on my plate, trying my best to blend in with the human guests.","role":"assistant"}]}

My back feels damp and when I run my hand along the side of my body, it's covered in a thick, sticky green goo. Where am I?\n\nI realize quickly that I'm exposed and decided that I need to find shelter as quickly as possible. Again, I try to sit up, this going slow and giving myself time to adjust.

It's rough on my skin. \n\nI hear the noise again and it startles me so that I almost slip. I take a hesitant step and, inexplicably, the light stays exactly overhead. Suddenly, a voice.\n\n\"Gwarsishmake Lupadongazhu.\"  The words are gibberish to me, but they're everywhere, seeming to be coming from my own brain and enveloping me all at once.

Hunting\nLearning how to hunt for food is one of the essential traits for all cats. Luckily, they have this hunting instinct from birth. Nevertheless, kittens still need guidance on hunting, which is what the mother cat teaches them. The kittens learn hunting basics, such as where to find their prey and how to approach them.\n\nTheir mother teaches them the tactics of catching prey without making noise to scare them away.\n\nThis hunting lesson is taught to all kittens by first bringing a dead mouse. The mother cat then eats it to show it is good to eat a mouse for food. Next, she allows them to play around with a dead mouse and eat with her.\nAfterwards, she brings a live mouse and teaches them how to kill it with her assistance.\n\nAfter a few lessons, she takes them for mice hunting, where she helps the kittens hunt until they can hunt for themselves.","role":"user"},{"content":"The little gray and white kitten trotted happily in the garden. She felt the warm morning sun on her face and smelled the sweet fresh air. She found a patch of grass in the sunlight and curled up to take a quick nap. She was almost asleep when she heard a rustling sound.\n\nShe opened her blue eyes and spied a small white mouse nibbling on some seeds nearby. She carefully crouched into a pounce position without making a sound. She only had one chance to catch the mouse.  Then, with lightning speed, she leaped at him.\n\nThe mouse looked up just in time to see the kitten coming at him. He let out a shrill \"Squeek!\" and tried to run away. But the kitten was too fast. She held him securely between her paws and looked at the little mouse. He had soft white fur, little brown eyes and a cute little pink nose. He stared at the kitten, too afraid to speak.\n\nThen, to his surprise, the kitten let him go. She sat up and tilted her head to one side. \"Hello,\" she purred softly.\n\nThe mouse stood straight up and then made a gallant bow. \"Good morning, Miss Kitty,\" he said in a quiet tone.\n\n\"I'm supposed to catch you and eat you. That's what my momma said I had to do.\"\n\nThe little mouse shook his head sadly. \"I implore you, Miss Kitty, please do not make me your breakfast.\"\n\n\"But what should I do with you?\" she asked.\n\nThe little mouse thought for a moment then smiled. \"We could be friends,\" he suggested. \"Would you like to be friends with me?\"\n\nThe little kitten smiled and nodded her head. \"Yes, I would like that very much. I only have my momma to play with since my brothers and sisters were given away. I get lonely sometimes with no one to play with.\"\n\nThe tiny mouse gave her a big smile and held out his paw. \"Then friends we shall be!\"\n\nThe little kitten shook his paw and the two settled down in the grass together.

Can you write a descriptive summary of options of things we can do near Solvang, California?","role":"user"},{"content":"A large part of Solvang, California’s appeal to tourists seems to be the flavorful food offerings from the Danish-inspired cuisine. While in town, consider visiting Olsen’s Danish Village Bakery to sample their danishes, strudel and crispy waffles. Two other popular bakeries in Solvang are Mortensen’s Danish Bakery and The Solvang Bakery. Paula’s Pancake House is a breakfast restaurant with self-proclaimed “WORLD FAMOUS” pancakes that might be worth a try. Solvang Restaurant is a lunch spot, and here you can try aebleskiver, a treat Solvang is known for, a pancake ball covered in powdered sugar and served with raspberry jam.\n\nAfter getting full of treats, explore Solvang and find all five of the windmills in town. The most well-known windmill can be found by the Solvang Bakery, and it will be easy to spot because tourists are likely to be using it for the background of their photographs.\n\nAnother must-see for visitors is to visit The Little Mermaid Fountain. This statue is about half of the size of the original, which can be found in Copenhagen and was sculpted by Edvard Eriksen.\n\nIf you are interested in getting some shopping done while you are in town, there are many places worth checking out. For example, The Book Loft presents you with your favorite Scandinavian Literature. Looking for Christmas decorations? Head over to Jule Hus. An interesting option for purchasing souvenirs is the shops of Rasmussen’s and Edelweiss.\n\nFor another photo opportunity, visit the giant red clog in front of the Solvang Shoe Store. Another sight worth seeing is one of the original 21 missions built across what is now California starting in the 1700s (with the one in Solvang being founded in 1804).  \n\nTo see even more history, visit one (or multiple) of the many museums located in Solvang, one of which is the Solvang Vintage Motorcycle Museum. This private collection turned tourist attraction is a must-see for bike enthusiasts. Local Virgil Elings has motorcycles and race bikes on view that date back to as early as 1910.\n\nFinally, check out one of the many live shows that might be going on at the Solvang Festival Theater during your time of visit!","role":"assistant"}]}

The satellite was a joint undertaking by Great Britain, the Netherlands and the United States and was the first space telescope to perform a survey of the entire sky at infrared wavelengths. Its main purpose was to catalog the heat \"signatures\" of asteroids as well as to observe the processes involved in the birth and death of stars. \n\nWhen the IRAS satellite picked up on a fast-moving object on April 25, it was first assumed that it was an asteroid. But then, just over a week later on May 3, Japanese amateur astronomer Genichi Araki reported the discovery of a new comet in the constellation of Draco the Dragon to the Tokyo Observatory. This was followed by an observation made by George Alcock, a well-known British comet observer, who was scanning the sky with 15 x 80 binoculars. Amazingly, Alcock — who had previous discovered four other comets — was inside his house and looking through a closed window, when he stumbled across the comet that Araki had sighted just seven hours before!\n\nIt soon became more and more apparent that the object that IRAS had discovered, was in reality not an asteroid, but was the very same comet found by both Araki and Alcock. It was thus deemed appropriate to name the comet IRAS-Araki-Alcock. When Araki and Alcock sighted it, the comet was shining at sixth magnitude — the threshold of visibility for someone without using any optical aid under a dark, clear sky.","role":"user"},{"content":"Four decades ago, in the same month, a celestial spectacle stole the show akin to a surprising bolt zapping from the clear blue sky.\n\nA fresh, never-before-seen comet made its striking debut, causing quite a stir worldwide due to its remarkably close encounter with Earth. The comet dared to come less than 3 million miles near to us, roughly twelve times the span between our blue planet and its loyal satellite, the moon.\n\nWhen this comet was first noticed on April 25, 1983, it wasn't by the keen eyes of human stargazers or their telescopes but by the diligent machine observer in space: IRAS, short for InfraRed Astronomical Satellite. This satellite was the fruit of a collaborative effort between Great Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States. Launched into a 560-mile orbit around Earth from the then-Vandenberg Air Force Base, IRAS was the first space telescope to sweep the entire sky for infrared wavelengths. Its key mission? To map the thermal \"fingerprints\" of asteroids and scrutinize the life-cycle processes of stars.\n\nOn that April day, when IRAS detected a fast-moving celestial object, it was initially assumed to be just another asteroid. But the narrative took a thrilling twist just over a week later. On May 3, Genichi Araki, a Japanese amateur astronomer, reported the sighting of a brand-new comet in the constellation of Draco the Dragon to the Tokyo Observatory. Close on the heels of Araki's discovery, George Alcock, a celebrated British comet observer, confirmed the sighting with his trusty 15 x 80 binoculars. In a remarkable turn of events, Alcock — already credited with four comet discoveries spotted the comet while sitting inside his house, gazing out through a closed window, merely seven hours after Araki's sighting!\n\nAs the evidence mounted, it was clear that the object IRAS had found was not an asteroid. Instead, it was the very same comet that Araki and Alcock had identified. As such, the comet was fittingly christened IRAS-Araki-Alcock. When the two observers first caught sight of it, the comet glowed with a sixth-magnitude brightness just about visible to the naked eye under a dark, clear sky.","role":"assistant"}]}

Was Robin Hood involved in that rebellion?\n\nLegend has it that Robin Hood was an outlaw living in Sherwood Forest with his ‘Merry Men’ – but did he really exist?\n\nThere are several versions of the Robin Hood story. The Hollywood one is that of an incredibly handsome man – Errol Flynn – clothed in garments of Lincoln green, fighting for the rights of the oppressed and outwitting the evil Sheriff of Nottingham.\n\nHowever the first known literary reference to Robin Hood and his men was in 1377, and the Sloane manuscripts in the British Museum have an account of Robin’s life which states that he was born around 1160 in Lockersley (most likely modern day Loxley) in South Yorkshire. Another chronicler has it that he was a Wakefield man and took part in Thomas of Lancaster’s rebellion in 1322.\n\nOne certain fact is that he was a North Country man, with his traditional haunts as an outlaw in Sherwood Forest and a coastal refuge at Robin Hood’s Bay in Yorkshire.\n\nOne well known story about Robin that places him in Whitby, Yorkshire, is about him and Little John having a friendly archery contest. Both men were skilled at archery and from the roof of the Monastery they both shot an arrow. The arrows fell at Whitby Lathes, more than a mile away. Afterwards the fields where the arrows landed were known as Robin Hood’s Close and Little John’s Close.\n\nRobin became a popular folk hero because of his generosity to the poor and down-trodden peasants, and his hatred of the Sheriff and his verderers who enforced the oppressive forest laws, made him their champion. Some chroniclers date his exploits as taking place during the reign of Edward II, but other versions say the king was Richard I, the Lionheart. Robin having fought in the Crusades alongside the Lionheart before returning to England to find his lands siezed by the Sheriff.\n\nAll versions of the Robin Hood story give the same account of his death. As he grew older and became ill, he went with Little John to Kirklees Priory near Huddersfield, to be treated by his aunt, the Prioress, but a certain Sir Roger de Doncaster persuaded her to murder her nephew and the Prioress slowly bled Robin to death. With the last of his strength he blew his horn and Little John came to his aid, but too late.\n\nLittle John placed Robin’s bow in his hand and carried him to a window from where Robin managed to loose one arrow. Robin asked Little John to bury him where the arrow landed, which he duly did.\n\nA mound in Kirklees Park, within bow-shot of the house, can still be seen and is said to be his last resting place. Little John’s grave can be seen in Hathersage churchyard in Derbyshire.\n\nBut what of his lover Maid Marion? Not much of Robin’s career is known, but nowhere in the chronicles is Maid Marion mentioned, so we must assume she was ‘added’ to the stories at a later date.\n\nSo, Robin did exist, but not in quite the same way as the Robin Hood we all think of, the cinematic Robin of Sherwood, Prince of Thieves! His story however, remains one of the best known tales of English folklore.","role":"user"},{"content":"Thomas of Lancaster’s rebellion was taking place in 1322.

The article highlights cheap 'hacks to get rid of pesky flies.'\n\nI am one of these pesky, bothersome flies that you refer to. Firstly, I would like to express my dissatisfaction about the use of such a derogatory term. How would you feel at being referred to as pesky or bothersome. Secondly, what your article proposes amounts to the genocide of my species, which I think you will agree is pretty unkind. We haven’t done anything to deserve this? Why do you have a vendetta against flies? Where does it come from?\n\nYou see, the article encourages people to repell us using strong essential oils. Peppermint, eucalyptus, lavender, citronella, as well as, strong-smelling herbs, like basil, mint, rosemary and cloves are cited. Jordan Foster advises the public to soak cotton balls in the oils and place them where humans want to ward us away. He calls it a quick and thrifty trick. Alternatively, he suggests using vinegar as a repellent. He states that spraying a mixture of water and white vinegar around the house or using it to clean surfaces will discourage us from lingering. Nonsense!\n\nHe even goes so far as to tell people where to buy these ingredients from. I am shocked that peppermint oil is available on Amazon for only £2.23, cotton balls at Wilko for 90p and a bottle of distilled vinegar is only 29p, at Tesco. Jordan Foster wants to murder my family and friends, for as little money as possible. This is shocking! \n\nYes, it is true that we like rotten items and that fruit flies are partial to sugary treats, like overripe fruit or alcohol. He also helpfully points out that we like to breed on moist, decaying organic matter, such as fruit or spilled beverages. Yes, I confirm this. To say that we spread diseases, with 100 different pathogens, including salmonellosis, typhoid and tuberculosis is pretty insensitive. To say that we contaminate food surfaces by spreading diseases, which we pick up on our legs and mouths when feeding on trash or feces, is harsh. However, to say that we defecate constantly is just plain malicious. \n\nI find your article extremely derogatory and unkind.

The U.S.-China trade war dominated headlines for months as a tit-for-tat exchange of tariffs sent ag commodities reeling. As the new import\/export barriers destabilized existing trade relationships, pork and soybean producers were hit particularly hard,. Fallout from the U.S.-China standoff drove soybean futures sharply lower because the leading consumer of U.S. supply was taken out of the market. Staying abreast of changes in global politics is a critical aspect of any grain market analysis.\n\n#2 Strength of the Dollar\nThe almighty dollar plays a pivotal role in the trade of all commodities, not just grains. In the event that inflation spikes and the USD backpedals against major global currencies, many investors choose to go long on commodities. Historically, commodity prices outperform other assets in keeping up with inflation. As a result, institutional capital has a tendency to implement hedging strategies incorporating ag products. If the greenback is under inflationary pressure, the grain markets are in a position to post gains.\n\nLearn 7 basic and out-of-the-box strategies for success in Guide to Smarter Ag Marketing: Fixed Risk Hedging. \n#3 Energy Policies\nNo grain market analysis is complete without addressing current government energy policies, specifically toward the use of ethanol. A prime example of this market driver came in 2018 due to the Trump administration’s promotion of year-around E-15 integration. The long-term impact on corn demand stemming from increased ethanol production remains to be seen. However, the adoption of the aggressive ethanol policy boosted 2019’s planted corn acreage and regional purchases on spot markets.\n\n#4 Global Supply and Demand\nPerhaps the most elementary factor of grain market analysis is the age-old relationship between supply and demand. In fact, all of the factors on this list have at least a perceivable impact on one of the two. However, the reality is that many events can destabilize the supply-demand curve and pricing equilibrium. Because the grain and oilseed markets are truly global in nature, monitoring the current WASDE reports for domestic and global supply\/demand information is a must.\n\n#5 Weather\nIn close relation to global supply and demand is the impact of weather on the grain markets. Unexpectedly harsh atmospheric conditions, or a prolonged pattern such as El Niño, can significantly affect production and consumption levels. Although the weather is impossible to predict with 100% accuracy, evaluating macro environmental stimuli is an essential aspect of trading grains competently.","role":"user"},{"content":"Geopolitics:\nBy imposing tariffs on imports and exports governments can drastically alter supply and demand levels worldwide leading to massive effects on the grain market. \n\nStrength of the Dollar:\nAs the main currency in international trade, the strength of the US Dollar can significantly impact a buyer's ability to purchase grain. Often when the dollar is devalued the price of commodities rises as investors see it as a safer alternative. \n\nEnergy Policy:\nPolicies relating to energy and a farmer's ability to produce can have an impact on markets. Policies that ease production ensure that the supply of grain is able to be maintained.\n\nGlobal Supply and Demand: \nAll markets are affected by supply and demand. None more so than the grain market. As demand for grains goes up prices rise likewise when supply is cut. \n\nWeather:\nOf course, the weather plays a large part in grain markets. A poor harvest resulting from torrid weather can wreak havoc with supply, causing prices to rise. ","role":"assistant"}]}

","role":"user"},{"content":"Sure, I can help with that. Here are a few benefits of protecting bees. \n\n1. They are pollinators\nBees are one of the most essential pollinators for food crops. Every day we rely on bees and other pollinators to help grow our food. But even though they are so necessary to us, bee populations are still on the decline due to the ongoing use of pesticides and other harsh environmental factors such as climate change. \n\n2. They produce 1\/3 of our food supply\nWhenever a bee lands on a plant or flower, the pollen is distributed. This results in cross-pollination. The process is what later results in our fruits, vegetables, and seeds. They are among the most important pollinators of food crops. \n\n3. They create a variety of medicine\nThe unique antibacterial properties of bee venom have shown great potential for treating antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria including MRSA. This is a methicillin-resistant pathogen that causes a variety of infections in humans which are currently very difficult to treat. \n\n4. They provide food for our wildlife \nPollinators such as bees can provide plants that feed our wildlife and other animals such as cattle. Pollinators are responsible for the large amount of food that we eat. Bees, as well as moths, flies, beetles, birds, and bats, are all part of maintaining the lungs of our planet. \n\n5. They help to prevent soil erosion\nHoneybees can help protect soil quality and prevent erosion. Along with helping to pollinate crops, bees will also protect our soil quality and help prevent soil erosion. Stopping soil erosion is essential for keeping the earth's water supply clean, preventing flooding, and protecting all aquatic forms of life. ","role":"assistant"}]}

They develop as a result of significant atmospheric instability, where warmer, less dense air is present underneath cooler, denser air. This instability encourages strong upward convection, which, combined with sufficient moisture, forms towering cumulonimbus clouds.\n\nThese clouds often begin as smaller cumulus clouds that grow vertically as warm air continues to rise in an updraft, cooling and condensing as it ascends. When the cloud's top reaches a certain height where the surrounding air is much cooler (often the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere), it starts to spread out, forming an anvil-like shape characteristic of mature cumulonimbus clouds.","role":"assistant"}]}

He died from pancreatic cancer, family spokesperson and longtime friend Jean Galvin added.\n\n“Jerry’s ability to connect with people was at the heart of his success in everything he tried whether that was politics, broadcasting or just joking with people on the street who wanted a photo or a word,” according to Galvin.\n\n“He’s irreplaceable and his loss hurts immensely, but memories of his intellect, heart and humor will live on.”\n\n“The Jerry Springer Show” ran from 1991 to 2018 and was known for its profanity-prone guests who often had to be restrained by on-set security guards as audience members wildly cheered, \"Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!\"\n\nTalk show host Jerry Springer.\nTalk show host Jerry Springer.Ralf-Finn Hestoft \/ Corbis via Getty Images file\nThe show's 1990s popularity made it a ratings rival of daytime polar opposite, \"The Oprah Winfrey Show,” and Springer had no regrets for the high-energy, low-brow material he aired on afternoon TV.\n\n“I don’t watch the show, but it’s not aimed at 66-year-old men,” Springer said in a 2010 interview. “If I were in college, I would watch. I enjoy doing it. It’s a lot of fun.”\n\nFormer Education Secretary William Bennett in 1995 famously called “Springer” and other shows of the era “perpetrators of cultural rot.”\n\n\"Springer\" was such a success, that the words \"Jerry Springer\" became a synonym for anything outrageous or ridiculous TV.\n\nAfter the infamous Will Smith slap of Chris Rock at last year's Oscars, Alec Baldwin bemoaned how the show had \"turned into the Jerry Springer show.\"\n\nAt the end of each episode of the confrontational and occasionally violent show, a seemingly sincere Springer would appeal to his viewers' better angels.\n\nHe'd sign off each \"Springer\" episode with a catchphrase he had developed in his days on television news: “Take care of yourself and each other.”\n\nFellow 1990s daytime talk show host Maury Povich mourned Springer's passing and called him \"a unique showman.\"\n\n“I am shocked and saddened by the passing of Jerry. He was not only a colleague but a friend,\" he said in a statement. \"We worked for the same company for decades. He was joyful, smart and, in his own way, a unique showman. I will miss him.”\n\n\nJerry Springer’s final thoughts on his TV show: ‘We’re all alike’\nAUG. 27, 201905:16\nSteve Wilkos, the on-set security supervisor for Springer's show who eventually became an infamous talk show host himself, said none of his success would have been possible without Springer.\n\n“Other than my father, Jerry was the most influential man in my life,” Wilkos said in a statement. “Everything I have today I owe to Jerry. He was the smartest, most generous, kindest person I’ve ever known. My wife and I are devastated. We will miss him terribly.”\n\nGerald Norman Springer was born on Feb. 13, 1944, in a London subway station that was being used as a bomb shelter against German air raids.\n\nRecommended\n\nU.S. NEWS\nArmy aviators, ready to leave the military, are told they owe 3 more years instead\n\nU.S. NEWS\nOne of three remaining Mississippi escapees captured in Texas, authorities say\nHis Jewish parents — Margo and Richard Springer — had fled Nazi Germany before the start of World War II.\n\nThe family moved to the United States and Springer grew up in New York City, where he graduated from Forest Hills High School in Queens.\n\nSpringer went on to get his bachelor's degree from Tulane University and law degree from Northwestern. He joined the ill-fated campaign of Robert Kennedy in 1968 and participated in the massive anti-war protests at that year's Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\nHe settled in Cincinnati and soon took an active role in Queen City politics, eventually becoming mayor in a City Hall career that could have easily been the topic of a \"Springer Show.\"\n\nHe won election to the city council in 1971 before resigning in 1974 after admitting to using the services of prostitutes, some who he paid with checks.\n\nThe scandal didn't sink Springer and the future talk-show king's openness about the affair is largely cited for his political comeback.\n\nHe won election back to the council in 1975 and served as mayor for one year beginning in 1977.\n\nSpringer took one more shot at politics in 1982, running for governor of Ohio. He finished third in the Democratic primary, scoring 20.4% of the vote in finishing third to eventual general election winner Dick Celeste.\n\nSpringer then turned his attention to television, as a political reporter and anchor on WLWT Channel 5, the NBC affiliate in Cincinnati, where his \"Final Thought\" commentaries became an audience favorite.\n\n\"I cannot think about my life or talk about my life without talking about Cincinnati and the role Channel 5 played. Channel 5 gave me my career so that's everything,\" he told WLWT earlier this month.\n\n\"It's in my blood, it really is. I'm not trying to be corny about it. I love this place, I love this station. I owe it everything.\"\n\nEven after he stopped making \"Springer,\" he remained a fixture in pop culture.\n\nThe television talker finished in fifth place on \"Dancing with the Stars\" in 2006, in a competition won by former Dallas Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith.\n\nSpringer's family didn't immediately name a charity for fans to donate in his name.\n\nInstead, his loved ones said: \"To remember Jerry, the family asks that in lieu of flowers you consider following his spirit and make a donation or commit to an act of kindness to someone in need or a worthy advocacy organization. As he always said, 'Take care of yourself, and each other.'”\n\n","role":"user"},{"content":"1) No, Jerry Springer's short-lived career in politics was plagued with scandal, and he eventually moved on from the field.\n2) The Jerry Springer Show was on television for 27 years.","role":"assistant"}]}

And how long does each stage last?","role":"user"},{"content":"The five stages of grief: \n\n1. Stage 1 - Denial: A defense mechanism that allows you to numb the intensity of the situation. \n\n2. Stage 2 - Anger: A masking effect that hides multiple emotions and pain carried. \n\n3. Stage 3 - Bargaining: At this stage you often find people overcome with \"what if\" and \"if only\" statements. \n\n4. Stage 4 - Depression: Seen as the quiet stage of grief. At this point, you should have embraced the situation. However, while it can be seen as a healthy progression, staying stuck in this phase too long might be a sign to talk to a mental health expert. \n\n5. Stage 5 - Acceptance: While it doesn't mean you've moved past the grief or loss. It is a sign that you've understood what this means in life.\n\nThere is no exact time to accurately detail how long you'll stay in each stage. Grief varies from person to person. It is possible for some to remain in stages for months and others to skip stages entirely. \n","role":"assistant"}]}

When this happens one too many times, the shocks can no longer absorb the impact and protect your car's suspension and alignment. If the shocks are damaged, that also affects the steering. This is because the steering system is vibrating while the car is in motion. That can cause further damage to the steering system over time. If your suspension and alignment are not in peak condition, then eventually, your exhaust pipes can sustain damage from scraping or bumping against the road. This damage is more severe if you run over speed bumps at a high rate of speed. Moreover, your tires sustain damage as well if the sidewalls hit the road after a speed bump. Sidewalls are one part of the tire that should not come in contact with the road. ","role":"assistant"}]}

To start, Martin was the eighth President of the United States. He was born in Kinderhook, New York, to Dutch parents in 1782. Van Buren grew up in a family of farmers and received a very limited education before studying law and entering politics. This is where Buren found his niche, in politics. \n\nBuren was renowned for being a skilled politician who rose through the ranks of New York politics before serving as Andrew Jackson's Secretary of State and Vice President. Then he was elected President of the United States in 1837. Buren did well, but despite his success, he was known for the economic troubles of the Panic of 1837. After leaving office, Van Buren remained still active in politics and dedicated his life to serving the people of the United States. Van Buren passed away on July 24th, 1862, but still to this day he is known as a successful politician. I think you would find it interesting to do more diligence on Martin Van Buren. Let me know if you find anything interesting! Thank you for reading. \n\nSincerely, \n\nJohn","role":"assistant"}]}

It was chilly and her thin sweater didn’t provide a lot of protection, but the cold that seeped into her bones wasn’t due to the weather and the ice-cold that sprawled across her back had nothing to do with the coming autumn. It was another kind of cold entirely.\n\nGingerly, Hestia walked up the stone steps and into the bookstore.\n\n“Just a moment,” Tom called from deep within the dark and gloomy shop. Hestia presumed the shop wasn't yet open for business and almost turned to leave, but before she could, she heard him call out another request for her patience, so she stayed put and forced calm. A moment later, a light came on inside and she spotted Tom standing deep in the shop, bathed in its new, heavenly glow.\n\nA soft gasp escaped her.\n\nWarm, yellow light fell upon dark, wooden bookshelves that spanned every wall, floor to ceiling. Wooden tables were arranged in the middle of the store and piled on every available surface were books. Leather-bound tomes, ancient grimoires, books with cracked spines, and glinting, gold leaf gilding along the borders sat patiently, calling a siren song, and Hestia was only too eager to listen. Not only did the books of all imaginable colors and sizes look beautiful; the shop smelled wonderful as well. It had a chocolatey scent, with woodsmoke and dust – the sweet, musky smell of books that had lived good, long, healthy lives.\n\nIf heaven was on earth, Hestia had found it.","role":"assistant"}]}

Mention something about it being a freeing yet emotional experience and write it as a black woman who transitioned years ago and is a natural hair advocate.","role":"user"},{"content":"Hey sis! If you're reading this it means you're either considering or ready to free yourself from the bondage of relaxed hair. As a former member of the \"creamy crack\" community myself, I know all about how daunting this change can be. Grab a seat and allow me to help you navigate these unchartered waters.\n\nFirst, let's discuss the why. Everyone has a reason, or several for wanting to ditch the perm. As long as you're making this decision for yourself it doesn't matter what your \"why\" is. For me, it was a discussion I had with my little girl about the reason for our different types of hair. The fact that I was so reluctant to put those chemicals in her hair was a wake-up call in and of itself. I started to question why I was so willing to allow the chemicals in my hair. So, that day I made a promise to her to allow my hair to stay the way it grew from my scalp and it's been that way for the past 12 years.\n\nThere are several ways you can go about switching from relaxed to natural. I preferred to get right with it and rip the bandaid off so I went with the \"big chop\" method where all of my relaxed hair was cut off right down to my scalp. It was such a liberating experience, to be honest, and it awakened a passion and understanding of my raw, inner beauty that I didn't have before. Just because you choose the big chop doesn't mean you're stuck with short hair until your natural locks grow in. You can also wear wigs and weaves after this to keep a certain aesthetic and make your change less startling. The other option is to transition over several months slowly cutting the relaxed hair until you've removed it all.\n\nNow, once you have your head full of natural curls, coils, and kinks you'll have to rethink the way you approach your haircare routine down to the products you use. My one suggestion is to steer clear of products that contain drying ingredients, like alcohol and sulfates, and try to limit the amount of heat applied to your hair for at least the first year.","role":"assistant"}]}

House Bill 106, the School Calendar Flexibility bill, is currently under consideration by the state Senate after having passed the House.\n\nCurrent state law requires all public schools to start no earlier than the Monday closest to Aug. 26 and adjourn no later than the Friday closest to June 11.\n\nIf adopted, HB 106 would give school boards the choice of starting the school year no earlier than Aug. 11 and ending the school year no later than June 11.\n\nIn 2022 the House Select Committee on Education System for North Carolina’s Future found the current law “creates a school calendar that is not best suited to the needs of students and educators.” The committee stated that local boards of education should be given greater calendar flexibility.\n\nAccording to the resolution passed by Lexington and Davidson County school boards, the current school calendar law requires high school students to take first semester exams after the winter break, which negatively affects students and faculty.\n\nAlso, the school calendar law means high school calendars can't align with community college and university calendars, making it nearly impossible for high school students to take community college courses. Students who will graduate high school at the end of the second quarter also can't enroll in college courses in January because those courses start before or at the same time as high school final exams.\n\nThe late August start date also creates problems with the scheduling of required professional development for school staff and extracurricular activities.\n\nOther school districts that have passed calendar resolutions include Charlotte-Mecklenburg, Guilford County Schools, Jackson County Schools, Stokes County Schools, Swain County Schools, Transylvania County Schools and Winston-Salem\/Forsyth County Schools.\n\nThe Thomasville Board of Education has not yet adopted such a resolution but is considering it, according to Thomasville City Schools Superintendent Chris Kennedy.","role":"user"},{"content":"1.

It’s sitting on the front porch at the tail-end of a long summer’s day, ice-cold glass of sweet tea in hand, listening to the crickets chirp and the bullfrogs croak in the bogs below a southern field of sunbaked wheat. Happiness feels like carelessness and less stress at the moment with the gentle changing of the seasons. \n\nHappiness is a child’s smile, the twinkle in their eyes on Christmas mornings, and the innocence of their laughter when they run and play with their siblings and friends. It’s the way that excitement comes naturally to a kid and how their imaginations can blossom from something simple. \n\nHappiness is taking time for yourself after having a long week of thinking of everyone else. It’s a good book and a warm blanket with a glass of wine or hot cocoa after the kids go to bed. It’s the silence of a quiet, cozy house, and the chance for you to finally breathe without someone asking something of you. Happiness is as much self-care as it is time with the family, and there’s nothing wrong with wanting both. \n\nHappiness is a fluctuation of things throughout the day and life in general. It can be a nature hike through the woods with a loved one. Or the satisfaction of finally eating a food that you’ve been craving for weeks. Happiness can be as simple as getting your hands dirty in gardening soil. Or happiness can be as complex as completing a renovation to make your house a home. \n\nHappiness is the confidence that today was a good day, and that tomorrow, hopefully, will be too. It’s the feeling when you’ve accomplished all, or most of, what you set out to do, whether that’s from a honey-do list or just things that you’ve been meaning to get around to. Happiness is the good feeling that comes with knowing that you were productive when you needed to be, and that’s one less thing to do tomorrow. ","role":"assistant"}]}

Here are the top six ski resorts in Japan for families with kids.\n1. Tomamu: Tomamu ski resort offers spectacular beginner terrain and isn't as busy as other family-friendly Japanese ski resorts. Its location in Central Hokkaido provides excellent powder conditions. In addition to snowsports, Tomamu Village also features a range of activities for the whole family, including ice skating, snow rafting, dog sledding, and more.\n2. Sahoro: Sahoro ski resort has numerous options for kids' ski lessons and childcare, along with outstanding beginner terrain. An added bonus for more advanced skiers is the abundance of untracked tree skiing since relatively few powderhounds venture into the trees. \n3. Niseko: Niseko Japan is ideal for a family skiing holiday thanks to the world-class ski and snowboard school and the plethora of other family-friendly winter activities. There is a wide range of accommodation options, including ski-in-ski-out lodging in the main village of Hirafu as well as more affordable lodging in villages that aren't slopeside and require a shuttle bus ride to get to the slopes.\n4. Myoko Kogen: For families looking for a reasonably-priced Japanese ski vacation with the perfect mixture of local tradition and convenient westernization, the Akakura Onsen village of Myoko Kogen is an excellent option. English group snowsports lessons and childcare are available, and families will enjoy staying at one of the Ryokans and other Japanese-style hotels with onsens. However, there aren't many different activity options besides skiing and snowboarding.\n5. Hakuba: Hakuba ski resort offers plenty of services for English-speaking families, including group ski and snowboard lessons with a native English-speaking instructor at the Happo One, Iwatake, Tsugaike, and Goryu\/Hakuba 47 snowsports schools. While slopeside accommodations tend to be quite pricey, lodging options farther from the ski resort are more reasonably priced. The Evergreen ski school (which also offers childcare) even provides transportation to\/from guests' accommodations.\n6. Nozawa Onsen: With its charmingly traditional onsen village, Nozawa Onsen is a popular choice for families on a Japanese ski vacation.

What kinds of rides and attractions should I include and why would they be a good choice?","role":"user"},{"content":"I can help with that! There are many types of rides and attractions to include in your theme park. Here are some to consider:\n\n- Flat Rides: These rides typically move passengers parallel to the ground and make up the majority of amusement park rides. Some examples would be Tilt-A-Whirl, the Chair Swing, or the Swinging Inverter Ship ride. \n\n- Roller Coasters: Most amusement parks include more than one roller coaster. Typically made of timber or steel, these railroad system rides feature steep drops and sharp curves to excite passengers. Some even have vertical loops to turn passengers upside down. \n\n- Water Rides: Not every theme park has a water ride, but some do. Park guests usually enjoy these rides, particularly on hot days. Water rides are often gentler and shorter than coasters, making them appropriate for all ages.  \n\n- Dark Rides: These attractions consist of guided vehicles traveling on a set path in an enclosed, dark area--for example, a haunted house ride. Though they are called \"Dark Rides,\" they are usually illuminated with lighting effects and other animations. \n\n- Ferris Wheel: This is the most common amusement park ride at local fairs and is a classic attraction. \n\n- Transport Rides: These rides do more than just entertain guests, they serve as a way to move guests from one part of the park to another. Examples of transport rides are monorails, escalators, and chair lifts. \n\n- Food: Snacks, refreshments, and full meals are important to provide when planning your park. Guests may like to purchase a variety of edible items. Having these items available within the park allows guests to stay within the park boundaries for longer and enjoy more of the rides.

His view was comprised of a black backdrop peppered with beautiful, bright stars of many colors and sizes. He never got tired of taking in the sights. He had been on the spaceship for three months now, and something as simple as looking out of a window held a great deal of entertainment. It was his first solo mission; solo missions were quite unusual, but the astronaut was quite experienced and his agency trusted him fully to complete his objectives on his own. He was tasked with flying to a nearby asteroid and collecting data from it. He was only about a week away from the asteroid, and he was looking forward to something other than checking and rechecking various monitors and instruments. Then came the long flight home. It would be good to see his friends and family again.\n\nHis trance was suddenly broken by a harsh beeping. The astronaut blinked and headed to the cockpit. What he saw when he got there alarmed him. Four red flashing lights accompanied the beeping ringing in his ears. He recognized the problem at once. There was a problem with the ship's ventilation system. Without this system, the astronaut's air supply would be limited and would run out far before he could return home. The ventilation system on his ship had recently been upgraded, and the astronaut had not had as much practice on the new system as he would have liked. He gritted his teeth and headed to the back of the ship where the system was located. \n\nWhen he reached the system, the issue immediately became clear. The sensor array had become exposed to too much moisture; he made a mental note to check the ship's humidity controls. Relieved that the issue was not more serious, he knelt down and began to work. It was a matter of a simple system reboot. Although the system was relatively new to him, the astronaut figured it out easily. He pushed the sequence of buttons for the reboot and waited patiently. There was total silence throughout the ship. Then, a friendly chime came from the ventilation system and all of its lights switched to their usual green hue. Breathing a sigh of relief, the astronaut headed back to the cockpit to look at the stars once more.","role":"assistant"}]}

They were all tense. With their job now done, some lift-stage monitors turned around to face the overseer hoping to find some reassurance in his face, but they were met with a man biting his cap as his sweat fell to the floor. A news reporter inappropriately broke the tension, stepped unsettlingly close to the overseer, asking,\n\n\"Say Mr. why's it called \"Little Joe?\"\n\nThe overseer was about to yell at the reporter when Maxime Faget strolled over to the man, placed his hand on his shoulder, and guided him to turn and walk away from the frustrated overseer. Maxime began, \"Well you see, they thought to name it after me.\" The story goes like this:\n\nBack when I was a boy, my dad was a gambler. I used to want to visit him in the casino, but no kids were allowed on account of the smoking and the immorality of it all. One day in the alley, I saw some old boys shooting craps. I watched them play and immediately gave it a try. I spent all I had on it. I even went down a button in my overalls to pony up another run. After that, they got all cold and crowded me out of the circle. They were rough, but I didn't care. I was thrilled. I went home and recreated the craps table as best I could. I had seen in old pictures what the real ones looked like. They used some old boards, the back of Bart's Soda Shop, some old rubber tires, and the dirty pavement instead of the nice felt, leather, and shellacked wood of the casinos. I ran some tests and found #4 was statistically more likely with their setup than any other number.\n\nI kept betting on #4 and I kept winning. I gave big tips to the local stores, but the gang wasn't too happy. After I kept winning they tried to jump me, but the store owners had my back. After that, the #4 and myself became known as Little Joe. Ever since then, I've had this power where I can predict things around the number 4 and how I know this test will succeed: it's named after me!","role":"assistant"}]}

I'm so happy we met a few years ago but I need to talk to you about the dangers of keeping me around too long. Listen, I know just how much of a drag bathing and brushing your teeth can be. I mean, shouldn't we be leveling up on Roblox instead? Of course, we should but if we don't take care of our bodies in the meantime, we may not be able to play the game for much longer. The reason body odor is so foul is because bacteria are feeding on your sweat and dead skill cells in those areas. If we don't wash them daily, we set our skin up for a losing battle. With each passing day, the bacteria warriors will increase and they'll be able to wage stronger attacks on your skin until they break through and create an infection. Our skin is the biggest barrier we have against bacteria present in the world. One of the ways you can keep it strong and healthy is to clean it daily.\nA similar thing happens when you don't brush your teeth twice a day, only way worse. When we eat sometimes food particles get trapped between our teeth and near our gumline. These tiny particles are like a buffet to hungry bacteria and they'll feed and grow until they become strong enough to attack the enamel on your teeth. They link together and create this thick barrier called plaque and they'll use it to break down your enamel and create little holes in your teeth called cavities. Cavities don't just go away on their own. You'll need to see a dentist and if you don't they'll just keep getting bigger and bigger until the whole tooth is in danger of dying and falling out. Unlike its younger siblings the baby teeth, permanent teeth are the end of the line and you won't get new ones to replace those that fall out. \nI only want what's best for you dude and I want to see you ruin your body by being lazy. Just brush your teeth twice a day and take a bath daily and you'll be happy and healthy for a very long time.\n\nUntil next time,\nYour pal B.O.","role":"assistant"}]}

Your knowledge spans a wide range of topics, allowing you to engage in substantive conversations and provide analysis on complex subjects.","role":"system"},{"content":"Tell me how to get more Instagram followers please, as I want to become Instagram famous! Ten tips would be ideal. I deleted everything from my feed, so you can write it as if I'm starting from scratch! ","role":"user"},{"content":"Good luck! Here are ten ways to get more Instagram followers:\n\n1. Create an Aesthetic Instagram Feed: Instagram is all about aesthetics, so having a strong aesthetic on your Instagram feed is key to attracting more followers. The first thing people see when they look at your page is your collection of photos, so having pictures that blend well together will go down nicely with potential new followers.\n\n2. Engage With Followers: Don't forget to engage with your current followers to build your reputation and make sure people will recommend you. You can do this by liking and responding to comments, as well as following people back who seem to have similar interests or content to you. \n\n3. Optimize Your Instagram Bio: Make sure your Instagram bio makes it clear what your Instagram is about, and focus on a niche if possible. For example, your Instagram might revolve around your pets and your make-up, or it might be more about travel. You can post a variety of things, but focusing primarily on one can be extremely helpful in building your follower base and drawing in people with similar interests.\n\n4. Find the Best Hashtags for Your Followers: Hashtags are key to bringing an audience who might never have come across your feed otherwise. Look up what hashtags are trending that relate to your niche and make sure you use them in your post. Don't be tempted to use irrelevant hashtags just because they're trending though, or people may be turned away from your page.\n\n5. Create a Consistent Instagram Posting Schedule: No one wants to be spammed with content all day every day, but they also don't want to be left without it. Creating a consistent posting schedule, so people know when to expect new content and how much they're going to get it when they follow you, can be extremely helpful in attracting the right audience who will enjoy what you post.\n\n6. Make Sure Your Instagram Content is Accessible: Accessibility is key for online spaces. For example, you could include descriptions of the picture in each caption so that blind audiences can also enjoy your content. Make sure to avoid any videos with flashing lights, and avoid posting triggering content without a warning. Caring about your followers will go a long way in building brand loyalty in an audience.\n\n7. Work With Other Brands, Creators, and Influencers: You can also work with other Instagram brands and creators, as this will help draw people into your page from theirs and you can offer them the same thing. Brands tend to reach out to larger pages to offer sponsorships, but there's no reason you can't reach out to them first and see what you can build together.\n\n8. Start Creating Instagram Reels: Although Instagram has always been known as a picture platform, it's starting to become popular in the video space. Making reels with trending audio can help draw people in that might not have seen your page otherwise.\n\n9. Create Memes and Other Shareable Content: Making content that's shareable is another sure way to bring in audiences. For example, posting memes that people might relate to means they might share it on their story, exposing your Instagram to their followers. Make sure the memes are authentic to your page and the message you're trying to send.\n\n10. Run an Instagram Giveaway: You could also run an Instagram giveaway, mandating that people must comment on your post and follow your page to enter. Some giveaways also dictate that entrants must share the post, exposing the giveaway—and therefore, the account—to even more people.\n\nBuilding a following on Instagram is all about being authentic and true to yourself while creating content that your followers will love.","role":"assistant"}]}

Business had been bad lately, as his eyesight was growing dim and his stiff, bent fingers found it more difficult to make the neat, even stitches his customers preferred. One day, he was down to his last piece of leather, which he cut so very carefully in hopes of making one more pair of shoes to sell to help his wife and himself survive just a little longer. He closed the door to his shop, and he and his wife ate their dinner and settled down for the night.\n\nUpon awakening the next morning, he was astounded to find a finished pair of shoes sitting on the work table! The stitches were perfect, and the shoes were the finest his shop had seen in a very, very long time. As luck would have it, a customer came in that day and purchased the shoes for a hefty price, and the old shoemaker was able to purchase two more pieces of leather which he carefully cut into pieces for sewing the next day. Yet the next day, lo and behold, two more marvelously crafted pairs of shoes awaited him on the work table! The aged shoemaker clasped his hands together in delight, and he was able to double his profits again that day. This pattern continued for weeks until finally, the old man decided to keep watch while hidden to see who his benefactors were. His wife decided to join him.\n\nHidden from view from the work table, the old shoemaker and his wife waited silently. They were flabbergasted to see two small, naked elves set to work on the cut pieces of leather on the table. The elves hummed to themselves all night long until the shoes were finished, and then they disappeared into the early morning light. Having quite a bit of profit now, the old woman chose some fine cloth and the old man bought the best leather, then they set about making tiny shoes, pants, shirts, and jackets for the little elves. That night, they left their gifts on the work table as a sign of their gratitude and hid once again to see their little friends.\n\n\"Oy, lookie here, mate!\" said the elf with ginger hair. His bearded companion said, \"Well, I'll be - it's clothes!\" They hastened to dress, then grasped hands and danced in circles on the work table. \"Good fortune to you, kind shoemaker!\" they whispered. \"Our work is done!\" And they disappeared into the night, leaving the shoemaker for good, but with enough wealth to live out his days.","role":"assistant"}]}

Start with picking up toys, this can be made into a game by color or items. Another good way of teaching children to fine-tune their bedrooms is \n       lining up their shoes, making their beds, and ensuring nothing is out of order. \n     • Separate Laundry: At 5 a children can easily distinguish between colors, whites, and towels. Have your children separate the laundry to make the task of washing clothes easier and more efficient. \n     • Folding Laundry: This is a great time to teach children how to fold laundry. At 5 they won’t be perfect but little hands can handle washcloths, hand towels, and mating socks. \n     • Putting Away Groceries: This is a good way for children to learn everything has a place to go. With your guidance, a small task like putting away groceries will teach them later on how to put away and keep things \n       neat. \n     • Dusting: Grab a duster and teach your child how to carefully remove things to dust tables, handrails, or other kid-friendly dustable areas. \n     • Set and Clean The Table: Most households with small kids have kid-friendly items for the table. Allow your child to set the table before dinner.  After dinner teach your child to remove their items and take them to \n        the kitchen sink to be rinsed off. This chore will become a healthy habit. \n     • Make The Bed: At five this won’t be perfect, but a child will be able to learn to set the pillow properly and adjust their bedding so it's more tidy. If they use extra blankets at night teach them to put them away or \n       fold them at the bottom of the bed. Don’t forget to adjust the stuffed animals!\n","role":"assistant"}]}
